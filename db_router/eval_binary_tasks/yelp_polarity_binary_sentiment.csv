A very scary place to go let alone eat.\n\nWell the place is huge seating for 100+ people and a large stage plus private boothes.\n\nThe chips are hard & flavorless and the salsa too tomatoey and no spice at all. NO BEANS either.\n\nThe prices were very moderate and the portions were fair but nothing really special.\n\nI ordered the Carne Asada plate for $10-the carne asada was nice & tender but it was not charbroiled as the description on the menu claimed.\n\nThe pico was weak and the jalapeno had no spice at all.\n\nMY wife had a carne asada taco which was pretty large and also a cheese enchilada which was the highlight of the entire meal.\n\nI was disappointed with the cleanliness of the place since there was NO crowd and it was also pretty lackluster food, NOT spicy at all.\n\nThank goodness I had a restaurant.com coupon for $10 OFF.",negative

This company is so unprofessional! I scheduled a three hour cleaning, left work early to be home when the cleaners arrived, and no one ever showed up. No phone call, nothing. In fact, it took an hour to reach someone at the office (during business hours). The man I spoke with told me he'd find out what happened and call right back. But did he call? No. I finally called back an hour after that, and after a few tries, he finally answered and said the cleaners' car had broken down and that they would come the next day instead. However, he had forgotten to ask them what time they'd be there and so promised he'd call me right back with the time. I didn't hear from him. I called the following day and a woman answered the phone. I explained what happened, she apologized, and promised to have someone come that day. She said she'd call in ten minutes to let me know when they would arrive. That was three days ago. I still haven't heard back. \n\nIn short, don't waste your time or your money.",negative

I do not understand the praise.\n\nHot & Sour soup was the best part of the meal.  Unlike most places, it wasn't loaded with corn starch and it had a nice kick.  On the other hand, there was barely any vinegar flavor, and it reminded me more of a spicy ramen broth than hot & sour.  Had to eat around the overcooked shrimp.  \n\nThere was something on the menu called Twice-Cooked Chicken; I expected it to be chicken that was boiled and then stir-fried (like twice-cooked pork) but it was just the battered chicken chunks from the orange/sesame dishes served in a brown sauce.  My fault for not asking.  The cuts of chicken were nice, but the coating was mushy and spongy, as other reviewers have said.  Sauce was bland.  \n\nIt was hard to pick a vegetarian dish since the restaurant's veggie selection is basically limited to the garnishes that go in the meat dishes.  I went with the Kung Pao Tofu; it had a random chunk of pork in it, and the tofu was so soft it was almost like eating pudding.  Sauce was bland.\n\nSide of fried rice was tasteless.   \n\nRestaurant had good ambiance and the wait staff was attentive.  Entrees were $10 for the tofu and $11 for the chicken, which was a bit high relative to portion size.  I feel that Dragon Wok is trying to be an \""""upscale\"""" Chinese restaurant in the model of PF Chang's.  PF Chang's is not one of my favorite restaurants, but at least their menu expands beyond the most basic of carry-out standards and they know how to fry their chicken.",negative

I wanted to get the whole Vegas experience for my birthday so I chose this club because it seemed like the best one reviewed on here in Vegas. We got there around 9:45 and there was a huge line to get in. Then once the doors opened at 10, the line was rather quick and we were in shortly. My friends and I had managed to see a promoter earlier in the day giving out passes to ladies for this club so we took them. He told us that the ladies would be free and the guys would get some sort of discount. Well, us ladies were free but the guys had to shell out $50 for cover. Drinks are also insane. $10 for beer and $12 for a mixed drink!  Ridiculous..but then again, it is Vegas and this is the number one club on the Strip right now so you gotta think about what you're getting. Other than that, the club was so extravagant and beautiful. I loved the whole layout. There were also plenty of places to sit down outside if you needed a rest. Some ladies were dipping their feet in the pool. There were sofas on the pool for people to sit on..and not just bottle service and there was even another area where you could go play blackjack or poker. The music was great..top 40 stuff that my friends and I enjoyed. Around 12ish, the place started getting super packed on the dance floor and we went on to our next destination on the strip. Overall, I think that while XS is an incredibly expensive club, its one of those once-in-a-lifetime things...something that I think everyone should try at least once in their life.",positive

I knew i wanted the hollandaise, but I was kinda curious about what this cajun sauce was too, and I think the server could tell I was conflicted so she brought be both on the side! The cajun sauce really tasted more like a creamy chili, actually. It was good, just not what I wanted on the omelet, so I slathered on the hollandaise and got to eating. There is an english muffin and a side of hash browns as well.\n\nThe omelet was quite delicious, though I would say the chicken was a little on the dry side--not terribly so but enough to notice it.

I think the desserts+coffees with one shot of Baileys was around $30.  The total bill was $121 + tip.  I would be choosier with the order next time because while it was fantastic, you could still have a great meal and dodge some of the expense.  For that amount of money, there are nicer meals you could enjoy in Charlotte.  We will return though because if the other pizzas are as good as that one, it's worth trying it and being smarter with the bill.",positive

Just remember that NONE of them are located in Downtown Las Vegas. \n\nThe establishment is located in the Fremont casino. It's large and maze-y with roomy booths. The decor isn't vintage; it looks like a 1980s highschool set for Wizard of Oz. There's alot of green.\n\nFirst off, our waitress didn't know what half-and-half was when we requested it with coffee. She kept pointing to the french vanilla creamer already on the table.

Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!",positive

This awesome steak and seafood house located in the Encore was one of the finest meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. It's also home to the largest wine list I have ever laid eyes on.\n\nOur server, Will was one of the main contributing factors to this as well as the amazing food and a restaurant ambiance that hasn't seen it's equal. \n\nWill was very patient with us as we looked over the menu. The level of quality service that he provided was astounding. He offered thorough explanations as well as suggestions on what we should try. We ended up ordering the lobster mac and cheese, green tea spiced ahi, and Montana bison. Yes, bison.\n\n-Vermont cheddar mac and cheese with Maine lobster: $18\nA very perfect portion of the best mac and cheese this stomach has ever digested. We both don't like mac and cheese but loved this one. The lobster portions in here were nicely cut and prepared. \n\n-Green tea spiced ahi tuna: $42\nThis was served with lentils and endive. It was a HUGE cut of ahi. Very fresh and seared to perfection. The green tea added a nice dimension of flavor here. I've had a lot of seared ahi in my day but none like this. Amazing.\n\n-Montana bison rib eye : $48\nThis was served with a very nice port wine sauce. It was cooked medium well and it remained juicy throughout. The bison was very lean and tasted very clean. It had no gamey taste at all. Very impressive.\n\n-Caramelized profiteroles : $12\nThink of these as very small cream puffs. I had never heard of this dessert before dining at Switch. The puffs were full of flavor and very light. It was the perfect way to end the meal. We didn't want to get bogged down at all: we had shopping to do.\n\nSo why call this place Switch? Well every 20 minutes the restaurant itself transforms. Wall panels give way to one of three different types and even the ceiling opens up and recesses to give a different point of decor for the discerning customer. This was a very nice touch and although I knew it was going to happen ahead of time thanks to Yelp reviews, they can't really prepare you for the real deal. I had never seen anything like it before in my life.\n\nSo thank you Switch, Will, and Montana bison for a culinary experience that will always be remembered.",positive

Isn't it soooo ridiculous? He claims they don't use MSG but I see he's defending its usage. What does this imply?\n\nFrankly, before the conversation, I felt a bit sorry about having given only 1 star rather than 2 and planned to edit because I still thought the staffs were so nice. But the conversation confirmed even 1 star is already too high.\n\nAlso I want to clarify. Deducting 4 stars was based on the taste only. MSG comment was only for those who are more sensitive.\n\nIn addition, my brief note on MSG. \n\nMSG hasn't been proven harm by FDA as he mentioned. However, some people like myself sense it by having headache, drowsiness and severe thirst soon after eating it, which are unpleasant. Also ramen soups contain MSG. Simply go to Amazon dot com, search Shin Ramyun and read the ingredient. Or simply follow the link. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00778B90S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&keywords=shin%20ramyun&qid=1342449390&sr=8-1\n\nHe claims he studied and researched a long time. Probably, he needs to spend more. Anyway, visiting this restaurant already gave me a lot of headaches and I am now blocking him.\n\n----------------------\n Shawn A.  Yesterday \n\nHi\n\nJK\n\nI am Shawn the owner of Mashisoyo. I am first sorry that you did not like our soondubu due to the taste of MSG.\n\nBut is is funny that you sense MSG in our tofu becuase we DO NOT use MSG at all.\n\nWe prepare natural broth every morning for the stew and natural ingredients.\n\nYour review is nothing but negative if you can't prove that we use MSG.\n\nIf you visit us again, I will give you a tour of our kitchen\nso you feel better next time you try our tofu.\n\nThanks\nShawn Ahn\nOwner of Mashisoyo\n\n----------------------\n  J K. Yesterday \nI ordered a spicy soup and it smelt like shin ramyon soup. Seeing you didn't deny the usage of ramen soup, probably you are using it? Even if you didn't intentionally use MSG, using flavored salt (Mat-so-geum) or ramen soup means the served soup should contain MSG. I remember the server saying you use special sauce for spicy taste. I don't know what kind of sauce you are using, but I am pretty sure it contains MSG or equivalent artificial flavor. \n\nI didn't even mention your pork bulgogi that also tasted like MSG or beef dashida. Please check the sauces you are using before claiming your dishes are free of MSG.\n\n----------------------\n  Shawn A. 6 hours ago \nfirst, there is no way you can buy ramen soup only from markets and even if we used shinramen soup it does not contains MSG so your guess is wrong again.I We are tofu house and I studied and researched a long time to find what our  fofu soup takes to be loved by people and people love our soup and bbq these days. They wait in line to have our food. You don't want to say they are wrong about our food.\n\nI advise you not to eat out if you worry so much about MSG because even a hamburger, taco burrito, fried chicken, pho, Thai, steaks, American BBQ,...many more use the ingredients have a bit of mono sodium but FDA says still it is NO harm to people.\n\nLastly I would like to say you in a nice way NOT to criticize easily. We put a hundres of hours , effort ,money, and love to our restaurant to make a living with our  love ones.\nThe comment like yours hurts us so much.\n\nThanks\n----------------------",negative

    "The 2 previous reviews want you to believe this is the best mexican party place around.\\n\\nI must have missed the party because at 12 noon it was completely DEAD-no lunch crowd.\\n\\nAnd they failed to mention this is in the Commercial Center plaza. A very scary place to go let alone eat.\\n\\nWell the place is huge seating for 100+ people and a large stage plus private boothes.\\n\\nThe chips are hard & flavorless and the salsa too tomatoey and no spice at all. NO BEANS either.\\n\\nThe prices were very moderate and the portions were fair but nothing really special.\\n\\nI ordered the Carne Asada plate for $10-the carne asada was nice & tender but it was not charbroiled as the description on the menu claimed.\\n\\nThe pico was weak and the jalapeno had no spice at all.\\n\\nMY wife had a carne asada taco which was pretty large and also a cheese enchilada which was the highlight of the entire meal.\\n\\nI was disappointed with the cleanliness of the place since there was NO crowd and it was also pretty lackluster food, NOT spicy at all.\\n\\nThank goodness I had a restaurant.com coupon for $10 OFF.",
    "If I could give zero stars, I would. This company is so unprofessional! I scheduled a three hour cleaning, left work early to be home when the cleaners arrived, and no one ever showed up. No phone call, nothing. In fact, it took an hour to reach someone at the office (during business hours). The man I spoke with told me he'd find out what happened and call right back. But did he call? No. I finally called back an hour after that, and after a few tries, he finally answered and said the cleaners' car had broken down and that they would come the next day instead. However, he had forgotten to ask them what time they'd be there and so promised he'd call me right back with the time. I didn't hear from him. I called the following day and a woman answered the phone. I explained what happened, she apologized, and promised to have someone come that day. She said she'd call in ten minutes to let me know when they would arrive. That was three days ago. I still haven't heard back. \\n\\nIn short, don't waste your time or your money.",
    "Tried this place based on the rave reviews.  I do not understand the praise.\\n\\nHot & Sour soup was the best part of the meal.  Unlike most places, it wasn't loaded with corn starch and it had a nice kick.  On the other hand, there was barely any vinegar flavor, and it reminded me more of a spicy ramen broth than hot & sour.  Had to eat around the overcooked shrimp.  \\n\\nThere was something on the menu called Twice-Cooked Chicken; I expected it to be chicken that was boiled and then stir-fried (like twice-cooked pork) but it was just the battered chicken chunks from the orange/sesame dishes served in a brown sauce.  My fault for not asking.  The cuts of chicken were nice, but the coating was mushy and spongy, as other reviewers have said.  Sauce was bland.  \\n\\nIt was hard to pick a vegetarian dish since the restaurant's veggie selection is basically limited to the garnishes that go in the meat dishes.  I went with the Kung Pao Tofu; it had a random chunk of pork in it, and the tofu was so soft it was almost like eating pudding.  Sauce was bland.\\n\\nSide of fried rice was tasteless.   \\n\\nRestaurant had good ambiance and the wait staff was attentive.  Entrees were $10 for the tofu and $11 for the chicken, which was a bit high relative to portion size.  I feel that Dragon Wok is trying to be an \\\"\"upscale\\\"\" Chinese restaurant in the model of PF Chang's.  PF Chang's is not one of my favorite restaurants, but at least their menu expands beyond the most basic of carry-out standards and they know how to fry their chicken.",
    "I was here on a Saturday night, 9/19, which happened to be my 25th birthday! I wanted to get the whole Vegas experience for my birthday so I chose this club because it seemed like the best one reviewed on here in Vegas. We got there around 9:45 and there was a huge line to get in. Then once the doors opened at 10, the line was rather quick and we were in shortly. My friends and I had managed to see a promoter earlier in the day giving out passes to ladies for this club so we took them. He told us that the ladies would be free and the guys would get some sort of discount. Well, us ladies were free but the guys had to shell out $50 for cover. Drinks are also insane. $10 for beer and $12 for a mixed drink!  Ridiculous..but then again, it is Vegas and this is the number one club on the Strip right now so you gotta think about what you're getting. Other than that, the club was so extravagant and beautiful. I loved the whole layout. There were also plenty of places to sit down outside if you needed a rest. Some ladies were dipping their feet in the pool. There were sofas on the pool for people to sit on..and not just bottle service and there was even another area where you could go play blackjack or poker. The music was great..top 40 stuff that my friends and I enjoyed. Around 12ish, the place started getting super packed on the dance floor and we went on to our next destination on the strip. Overall, I think that while XS is an incredibly expensive club, its one of those once-in-a-lifetime things...something that I think everyone should try at least once in their life."

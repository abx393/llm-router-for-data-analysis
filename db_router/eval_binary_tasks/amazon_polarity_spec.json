    "I ordered this book because my grandson loves horses and is having trouble with reading. I thought this would be a great book for him to practice his reading. I was so disappointed when the book arrived. The packaging was fine but the text was terrible. The stories were disjointed and made no sense. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I could have returned the book for a refund but chose to keep it and use it as an example of the worst writing I have ever read in a published book."

Count me as one of the many new AvA fans. AvA has a distinct sound that's all their own--and it's good stuff! Tom's voice is one of a kind and his lyrical ability is one of the best. Unlike Blink, AvA's lyrics are mature, optimistic, and uplifting--this is very refreshing and one of reasons I like their music so much. There is ""real""-ness and grit to the lyrics, but without the contrived angst that permeates so much modern rock.

I was really looking forward to this book given Kihn's other work, but this book just misses the mark. Kihn's characterizations are good, but they wear thin fast.The book has one chapter on an offsite meeting that's hilarious, but the rest of the book is weak. It's as if Kihn didn't have enough material to write a book, so several chapters have no real reason for being in the book.Overall, the book is rambling, not particularly interesting, and lacking in a theme--even though the title suggests one. The book gets one star because of the chapter on offsites and the use of upward feedback in consulting firms. If not for that, there'd be no stars.I'd save my money and pass this one by.What's interesting is that this book had several Amazon customer reviews, but somehow they've vaporized.",negative

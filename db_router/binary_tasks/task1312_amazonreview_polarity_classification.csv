I bought this when i had a few rough nights with my 6 month old and I was exhausted and desperate, thinking there would be some good recommendations for helping the baby sleep. She basically divides the book into two parts and uses 2 different acronyms to describe them. But basically theres nothing innovative here. The first part is for “good” babies. Basically fading techniques to gradually take away your babies sources of comfort until they comply. The second part is for those naughty babies who actually need more help getting to sleep. For that she recommends the extinction method, softened up by a new name and some witty jokes. The author seems like a very selfish person. She recommends sleep training at 2 months old. Most pediatricians wouldn’t recommend that. Im really happy I listened to my gut and stopped reading",negative

Although the description was inaccurate,that may have been a simple oversight as the blend of cotton to polyester in these socks was at one time true. I ordered these because they were described as cotton socks being primarily cotton with a lesser amount of polyester in the material. I thought this to be true as I had purchases them before from a retail store and was looking for an exact replacement. I hate how polyester socks feel on my feet. When I got the product, it is now a primarily polyester fabric with a lesser amount of cotton(in the 30% area if I remember right)making them polyester socks not cotton. I dont know why Hanes and Fruit of the Loom have stopped making cotton tube socks but it is really irritating. I am having no luck finding a suitable, quality replacement. To Amazon's credit they are paying the shipping for me to return them due to the inaccurate description which likely came from the manufacturer changing the blend without any more notice than the small fine print description on the back of the package stating the blend",negative

We were nervous to taste them since sesame often has a bitter nutty taste but not these products. If someone gave us a taste test and covered our eyes - we would never know the difference. There is no after taste and each one is creamy and delicious. We love they are plant-based and we're not only getting extra protein but they're ethical and good for the environment. While we continue to use them in our cereal, we had a taste for ice cream so we tried the chocolate in our ice cream maker. It was so good. Our kids had no idea it was not regular milk and practically licked their bowls clean. I was worried about the consistency but after 15 minutes in the mixer, you can see above it came out thick and rich. It was so tasty. Today we warmed up the leftover chocolate in the microwave for hot chocolate. The consistency stayed the same. If you are looking for an alternative to milk and don't want to consume dairy or lactose - this is the right option. We never have been a fan of soy, almond or oat milk so happy to find a nondairy alternative that's good.",positive

Neither of us is a train hobbyist; we purchased this to put on a table top around a small Christmas tree. Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together.",negative

But I am of the opinion that it is a sad and disappointing waste of materials, as well as time and money. The construction is awful and there is a degree of difficulty even for those experienced in DIY furniture assembly. The parts don't fit together properly, the Cam Lock aluminum hardware is soft and malfunctioning, and the pins pop out and are exposed through the cracks where the side boards and interior shelves should fit snugly and tightly. The end result is a lopsided piece of furniture, with misaligned doors, that can't be trusted to hold any weight. I had ordered the two other matching cabinets, the large and medium size, and had similar problems with their design flaws, and so decided against ordering the small cabinet as intended. At least the cabinets are still standing after a few months. Not this entertainment center! One day I moved it forward a foot or so to plug something into the wall behind it. I moved it back and opened one of the doors. To my chagrin, it fell out into my hand as it reached the open position in the center. Then I tried the other door and alas! the same. When I stood back to inspect I saw what appears to be warping to the bottom board. The doors simply fell from the tracks when they reached the low spot in the bend. That uncomfortable feeling of having been ripped off returned and I junked the thing. I'm not sure what to do with the cabinets as they were a set, but I am quite confident they won't last long either. Heaven forbid I need to move them at all! What a shame.",negative

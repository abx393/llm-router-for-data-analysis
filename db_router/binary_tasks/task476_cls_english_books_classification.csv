Regrettably, I bought this book (for one cent) based on the strong reviews.  I will never put so much credence in reviews again.  This would definitely not be one that you would thumb through at the bookstore and buy.  The author appears to have been introduced to child psychology about five minutes before writing this book.  His methodology is extremely juvenile and naive.  His whole approach is to have an arsenal of canned phrases that you tell your kid for various circumstances.      This doesn't sound like a bad thing at first until you find out what unimaginative over-simplistic blabber that ""Chick"" offers.  I could point out samples from every page of the first 25 that I read and the dozen or so others that I then skimmed through.  Just quoting this pansy-ass fluff turns my stomach.  Here is a story he tells a speaker who was distracted by a couple of kids talking at a lecture...     ""Frowning, he looked at them and very quietly said 'I'm feeling distracted by your behavior.  Please make a different choice.' By telling these students to make a different choice the speaker used language that communicated respect.  His message informed them 'I see you as responsible for your own actions.  You control your behavior.  You choose your responses to life.'    Every page has this same sickening tone to it.  If you want to avoid reality and miss the opportunities to affect your children in a way that builds self-esteem and confidence in them with real heart to heart interaction and instead gum them up with garbage talk then this book is for you.  Otherwise, to quote the author ""PLEASE MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE"" and find a better book or just use your own intuition and common sense.  This book teaches you how to destroy relationships by talking in mumbo jumbo out of the side of your mouth, while trying to keep a straight face.

Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you",NEG

This book is, I am convinced the best overall introduction to Christian ethics and the thought of Stanley Hauerwas.  Hauerwas has certainly written many wonderful books, but this one stands out in that it encapsulates a fairly coherent and articulate manner, his conception of what Christian ethics is and how they are lived out in the life of the church.    Hauerwas first offers a critique of ethics that would have pretentions to a universal status.  The way he states this is that all ethics require a qualifier ('Christian', 'Jewish', 'Hindu', etc.).  Every concievable ethic is grounded in a tradition and a narrative that gives substance to the ethical claims.  Thus, even though Christians believe that Christianity is true and Christian ethics are the right way for all people to live, this reality cannot be known without becoming a Christian, thereby making the stories of Israel and Jesus your story.  Thus, Christian ethics are not universal in the sense that they can be percieved as correct by anybody.  Rather to understand Christian ethics as true, one must be transformed through participation in Christ through the church.  This, of course grounds Hauerwas's claim that the church as a concrete community is the locus of Christian ethical reflection.    Obviously, the major theme of this book is nonviolence.  Hauerwas grounds this approach solidly on the narrative of the cross and resurrection of Christ which he holds to be decisive for the content of Christian claims about the world and life in it.  Over-against those who advocate an ethic of justifiable violence, Hauerwas contends that Christian ethics must be informed by the Biblical narrative of Christ, who won God's victory precisly through rejecting violence and inaugurating God's kingdom of justice and peace which the church is called to embody.  Hauerwas's ethic, contra Ramsey, Gustafson, Niebhur, Neuhaus, Stackhouse, Novak and others argues that Christ's teaching, life, death and resurrection should be decisive for our ethics, rather than dismissed as irrelevant.  In much of this Hauerwas draws on the excellent work of John Howard Yoder in ""The Politics of Jesus"" and ""The Original Revolution.""    This is a vitally important book, even for those who disagree with Hauerwas's Christ-centered, ecclesial ethic.  He very clearly shows in this book how his ethic takes into account the importance of deicisions and cooperating with non-Christians in the interest of social justice, issues that his critics often ignore in their overblown critques of his work.  This is a vital book for Christian theologians, ethicists and the all Christians who desire to take the gospel seriously.  Highly recommended",POS

I am one of a few Fixed Star astrologers in the world and no matter how much I read, study or research in this fascinating area, I will always come back to Ebertin's work. Though often his conclusions appear negative, if you will take them into the light of present life, you will understand how to derive the highest value for each star. For example when considering Algol, the star connected to beheadings, one can examine the aspects to this star and discover the person may have a tendency to lose their head in the aligned matters astrologically described. A star of extreme passion, Algol will also reflect the exact statements indicated by Ebertin - take Princess Diana's death or Nicole Simpson - both active under Algol at the time of their deaths.

I began reading this book in a local Christian bookstore. I was utterly shocked at the bad reasoning that is passed off in this book as ""proof"" that popular trends, including Pokemon and Harry Potter, as evil.    The author first claims that the vomiting and dizziness that some people experience while watching Pokemon is ""proof"" that Pokemon is Satanic. It's called 'epilepsy', Jacobs, and there were 1.4 million people who suffer from it in 1996.     She then claims that Pokemon ""encourages"" its players to cheat using the GameShark - a cheating device for those who don't know. This indicates lack of knowledge on her part. First of all, the GameShark is not a Pokemon phenomenon; you can cheat on almost any videogame. Secondly, I rather doubt that cheating on a videogame is proof of ""bad morals"" on the part of the gamer.    Jacobs concludes her Pokemon section by citing an instance when a fourteen year old Pokemon fan assaulted someone in his high school in order to obtain a Pokemon. Since when, exactly, has the bad behavior of one teenager reflected on an entire franchise? That's like saying that ALL Christians are responsible for the dishonest practices of televangelists like the Bakkers and Robert Tilton.    The section covering Harry Potter contains similar bad logic. Jacobs cites a quote from a young fan of Harry Potter who claims that they want to ""become a witch"", thereby reasoning that the entire Harry Potter franchise must be evil because of the acts of one fan.     She also concludes that Harry Potter ""must"" be evil because it is about witchcraft. The Bible contains historical accounts of entire civilizations being eliminated and many other violent subjects, but that doesn't mean that anyone who reads the Bible is murderous. It means that the Bible happens to contain violent passages.    Jacobs is supposed to prove conclusively that Harry Potter, Pokemon, Magic cards, and other trendy fads are Satanic, but I think that her arguments are quite weak. She more proves that these fads are NOT Satanic than she does prove that they are",NEG

Certainly it is not to my dismay that this will be the author's last edition.      Her information is all right in many ways, but useless in most.  If you want drug store quality cosmetics, you can find useful ones, some very good ones.  If you want very good quality cosmetics, more often you will pay for the increased quality.     Ms. Begoun says in the intro to this (hopefully) final edition, that she was hired by a mall in Silver Spring years ago.  Since I grew up in the Silver Spring area and still live nearby, I'd love to know what mall she's referring to.  Years ago there were no malls in Silver Spring.  A few shopping centers, but no malls.      She says she had acne and saw that toners didn't close pores, etc.  She's right in many ways, but she's way off in so many other ways her book is a mish-mash of misinformation mixed in with some basic common sense that anyone can figure out on her own.    If you want the very best cosmetics, you will have to patronize high-end stores like Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, etc.  The professionals there will help you find what is best for your skin.  It may take time, but all depends on what you want.     Ms. Begoun criticizes some very fine lines of cosmetics.  Maybe they don't work for her.  When I look through her book, it may be cleverly written, but she doesn't really know what she's talking about.    I had ""bad skin"" until I began using the Erno Laszlo line.  I had clogged pores, pimples, dry, scaly patches.  After a few months of using Laszlo and continuing to now, people I don't even know comment on how clear and pretty my complexion is.  Strangers don't comment on someone's skin for nothing.    When I see Ms. Begoun's book, I always turn to the section where she rips the Erno Laszlo line of cosmetics.  This edition, she omits what she has written in the past, that Laszlo customers are extremely loyal and swear by the product. There is a reason Laszlo customers are loyal.  It works better than any other line out there if you want your skin to look excellent throughout your life.     I have used Erno Laszlo for almost 32 years and no one ever believes that I am 53 years old.  Of course I don't look 20!  But my skin is smooth, the occasional dark ""age spot"" that appears fades within a few weeks of using Laszlo's wonderful ""No. 3-9"".  My husband is 47, looks younger than 47, and still everyone thinks he is older than me.  My lipline is smooth, lipstick has no vertical lines to bleed into when I wear lipstick, which is daily.      Ms. Begoun in this edition of the book says that Erno Laszlo could not have known about exfoliation or the dangers of rinsing with hot, hot water (part of his system requires 30 rinses of hot water twice a day), but that rinsing does exfoliate and I have no tiny spider veins on my face that she claims hot water can cause.  My cheeks are smooth and while gravity is taking its toll (Laszlo works, but gravity is a very powerful force and I don't expect to look 40 when I'm 70!)    She rips other up-scale cosmetic lines but I think that's because she has a conflict of interest.  Is she selling her own products?  I know previous editions promoted her own line of cosmetics, I didn't bother to find out if she's still doing so.      Erno Laszlo had as his clients years ago movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford - you can read in ""Mommy Dearest"" how Crawford's daughter thought her mother was obsessive in the way she rinsed her face repeatedly each morning and evening!    The reason Erno Laszlo had these clients is because his system works.    It's not cheap, it's very expensive, but it works.  Most definitely, it works.    Last week, I was ""carded""!  Quite a compliment for a someone who's been a mom for over 32 years",NEG

I found this to be one of the best Carole Matthews titles that I have read. Carole's books always present such interesting challenges faced by her protagonists when it comes to life and love, and this one is no exception.     Set in a small village on the outskirts of suburban England, Carole does an excellent job in capturing what life is like in a small town, with neighbors watching your every move, speculating and spreading rumors that sometimes only have a sliver of truth to them. She even reveals how wrong people can be about what is innocent, and what isn't in a small town through hilarious antics of a housewife turned prostitute.    The main character, Rose, is trying very hard to start a new life in a small town, but nobody wants to give her a break because they don't understand what she does as an aromatherapist, and mistakenly think she is a prostitute! As she settles in, she begins to fall in love with a local, who is going through his own relationship troubles. However, she is still torn by the affair that sent her fleeing from London. I couldn't stop reading as Rose tries so desperately to make the right decision, faltering for some time but eventually coming to terms with her feelings after a rather muddy encounter!

After I landed in Israel I re-took the book and was delighted again with the realness of it.

West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment.  In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.    The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.    At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.    The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota.    On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.    There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.    Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.

Fumon Tanaka sensei's mastery of kobudo, iaijutsu, and jujitsu is well articulated in this excellent work. The writing is much clearer than many Asian master's first works in English. The layout is extraordinarily well done with outstanding photos and illustrations that really augment the text. Content includes budo (martial arts) history, jujutsu, kenjutsu, and samurai tradition. The nito-ken (two-sword) techniques included herein are not widely taught and rarely described in other texts. Basic, intermediate, and advanced Honmon Enshin Ryu applications are well laid out, with many okuden (secret) mastry level techniques portrayed. The focus is primarily on sword to sword applications though there is also a small section on sword vs. yari (spear), naginata (halberd), bo (staff), and shuriken (throwing star) as well. There is also a bit of muto dori (no sword) techniques covered as well.    The author really knows his stuff and communicates it effectively. Tanaka sensei has been studying martial arts since 1956, achieving an 8th dan black belt in kobudo, 7th dan in jujutsu and kyoshi iai suemonogiri kenpo, 5th dan in Bojutsu, and 4th dan in kendo among other accomplishments.

The Corrections is the tale of the Lambert family, a pretty standard late 20th century Midwestern family.  Alfred Lambert, the father, suffers from an array of old-age medical disorders. His wife, Enid, lives in denial of his (and her own) problems and thrusts her frustration upon their now-grown children:  Chip, the failed academic turned New York screenwriter, Denise, the sexually confused upscale cook in Philadelphia and Gary, the maritally frustrated investment banker in Philly.  The plot follows the three children's lives as the fall apart, seemingly in sync with the collapse of Alfred's health.  The story is driven by Enid's desire to have her three children return home for Alfred's ""last"" Christmas.    Franzen does an amazing job of carefully winding the story together, introducing fun moments of ""aha!"" to the reader.  Recurring themes and motifs include mind altering drugs, the boom of the late 1990s, and the former Soviet Bloc.  Secondary characters connect primary characters together via seemingly random (yet believable) relationships.    I found this novel an interesting read, but I had a hard time getting through it.  The novel, at times, is horribly depressing.  The relationships of Gary, Denise, and Chip are painful to read, although maybe that's what makes this novel so captivating at times - you can really identify with the characters.

I have had these books on my shelf for a number of years, having never gotten around to them.  They should have stayed on the shelf, as I now know.      I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so I recognized many of the tropes that Pullman tries to pull off.  I must say that Holly Lisle pulls off the multiverse much better than he does, and that's not saying a whole lot.    Like most people here, I found myself drawn in by the first book.  That one was well written, if a bit heavy handed in how good Lyra was, how brave she was, how she could do anything even if it was previously impossible for anyone else to do - like break her father out of his Svalbard prison.  However, the books declined in quality from the first page of the second book.  Will takes it much too easily when he finds that he has committed his first murder, especially for a boy of 12.  As a reader, I am willing to suspend belief quite a bit, but this particular plot point snapped that thread for me.  Once that was lost, it was extremely difficult for me to engage myself with the text once again.    As far as the ending goes, what a disappointment.  It seems as if the third book was trying to tell three vastly different stories.  Frankly, if Pullman had created a novel entirely about Mary Malone slipping into the world that she did and studying it in a scientific capacity with no way to return, that would have kept my interest much more than his rabid defamation of Christianity.  Also, Pullman fails to deliver on the cohesion of comparing Mary to the serpent, Lyra to Eve, and Will to Adam.  There was no offering there by Mary of something to tempt Lyra with as happened in the Garden of Eden.  Without this crucial component, there is no way that Lyra can be Eve reincarnate.     The propaganda that Pullman purports as truth would be all right if he was claiming it as his own, and that if others believed it, that would be okay.  However, he very cleverly lulls the uncareful reader into believing that what he is saying is a universal truth.  I had no idea that atheism was so nihilistic, yet that is the view I came away with when I finished this trilogy.     I would never recommend these books to anyone.  Rather, I would steer them towards better fantasy novels - like Rowling, Tolkein, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip, and Ursula K le Guin",NEG

Gen is treated as a subservient fool and most times is thought of as nothing but a tool to enact the theft. This viewpoint lends a somewhat snide, yet funny and endearing perspective of the story.

As I read some of the reviews of people specifically one regarding David Ray Griffin books compared to this I must wonder about their motives. Although I have not read his books I read a few summaries, and concluded on some of the differences between them. David Ray Griffin seems to put all the blame and cover up on the Bush administration; it also seems to claim that there were explosives throughout the towers causing them to come down and not just the planes. It also claims that the pentagon plane never was a plane.     So how do you compare; Peter Lance doesn't claim that the Clinton administration or Bush Administration knowingly lied, it does however criticize both administrations for not looking into things like they should have. Obviously the Clinton Administration takes a harder hit here because they were in office from 93 - 00 when most of the planning took place. (yes I know it is hard for many bush haters not to put all the blame on Bush but this attack was planned well before Jan 1, 2001).     Peter Lance goes into extreme detail regarding the people involved in the 93 bombing and the people hunting/prosecuting them. There were so many things that were missed on all levels of our government from local police to the FBI to the white house. He does focus on the FBI's failure more than many other law enforcement because they are the group involved here at home. There are no conspiracy theories, the 93 world trade center attack happened; we know who did it. The USS Cole was attacked, Khobar Towers, the 2 embassies in Africa and 9/11. To suggest that some or any of these were committed or covered up by our goverment is insane.     Peter Lance details that there are people out there that are making their living trying to kill Americans and their allies. He gives us names, faces actual details. A history lesson in New York City law enforcment. There have been numerous books written about many of the same poeple or by the same people that Peter Lance mentions; John O'neil, Bob Baer etc... Read those books many say the same thing. SO is everyone on the government payroll covering up the White House Empires????    This book is based in facts that occured up to 9/11; it gives details and criticizes many people and administrations for not looking past the tips of their noses. It isn't based on conspiracy theories and is a great book. This book should be read by anyone wanting to know how inadequate our domestic law enforcment is at handling the new terrorist threat",POS

For example, a beginner is hit with all these tools--which ones are best, which ones to use, etc. Rosenbauer gives clear descriptions of which tools are most useful, what they're used for, and which ones you don't really need. At the same time, he gives tips from his experience--also useful for the expert.    The bulk of the book is, of course, the fly-tying receipes. He provides many photographs of each step in making a fly. The many photos are probably more than the expert will need, but very important for a beginner. For the expert, you get many great fly receipes.    Overall, highly recommended fly-tying guide",POS

Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, ""Okay, give it your best shot!""  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn",NEG

I just had the pleasure of reading an advance copy of John Naisbitt's Mind Set!: Reset Your Thinking and See the Future.  There's a lot in this book that I'd like to recommend for those who think everything is ""the next big thing""...  It's really not.    Contents:   Part 1 - Mindsets: Most Things Remain Constant; The Future Is Embedded In The Present; Focus On The Score Of The Game; Understand How Powerful It Is Not To Have To Be Right; See The Future As A Picture Puzzle; Don't Get So Far Ahead Of The Parade That They Don't Know You Are In It; Resistance To Change Falls For Benefits; Things That We Expect To Happen Always Happen More Slowly; You Don't Get Results By Solving Problems, But By Exploiting Opportunities; Don't Add Unless You Subtract; Consider The Ecology Of Technology  Part 2 - Pictures Of The Future: Culture - A Visual Culture Is Taking Over The World; Economics - From Nation-State To Economic Domains; China - Will The Dragon Devour Us Or Will It Be The Dragon We Ride?; Europe - Metamorphosis To History Theme Park; Our Evolutionary Era - No Next Big Thing  End Notes; Index    Naisbitt, the author of Megatrends, came up with a number of mindsets that can help someone understand where things are going in the future.  From that initial list, he pared down the items until he came up with what he felt are the most important eleven items that matter.  These mindsets, if understood, directly affect how you view current events and interpret your surroundings.  For instance, it's easy to look at each new technology and think that it will change everything.  But in reality, the same underlying forces continue to drive people's lives.  Business is in a constant state of flux, but it still ends up being all about buying and selling.  In sports, the one-handed jump shot in basketball completely changed the look of the game in 1936, but the game itself was still the same...  score a basket.  Once you strip away the fluff and hype, it's easier to understand where the general flow of life is going.  Or my favorite...  don't add something unless you subtract something.  Setting a cap on a situation (be it a sports roster or a number of menu items in a restaurant) forces you to weigh the merits of each item, keeping only the things that return value and dropping items that no longer measure up to the others.  Something to remember before you make yet another commitment...    Part 2 of the book applies a number of these mindsets to different current events and situations.  Personally, I found this part of the book a bit more unfocused than the first.  While I understand that the visual is becoming more important in today's society, I had a hard time staying focused on where the chapter was going.  He does tie the mindsets into the conclusions he draws, but I found the mindsets themselves to be more personally useful for my own life.    Definitely worth reading, even if you don't necessarily agree with him on how the mindsets play out.  I'll be revisiting the mindsets a number of times to get them firmly embedded in my brain.  And don't be surprised if I turn down some ""adds"" because I'm not ready to ""subtract"" something..",POS

In what ways do we misconceive love? Is love indeed an art? Why do we need it? What is the difference between love of a mother and a father (as archetypes)? He discusses different kinds of love: brotherly love (love to any other human being - just because he is a human being), erotic love, self-love, love to God.

I have heard claims that the Gospels are ""metaphor"" or that they were never meant to be taken as biographical (and therefore don't have much or any historical data).  This book ably debunks such claims.    The intent of this book is not to prove the historicity of Gospels, but to prove their genre.  By establishing their genre, then we can better understand the intent of the authors.    The well reasoned conclusion in Burridge's book is: the Gospels fit the ancient genre of biography.    In doing so he discusses a lot about genre and analysis (this section was a bit tedious for me, but it was thorough).  In all of the discussion and examples we learn how the ancient biographies are much different from modern ones.  This is a key point, because I think much of the debates and criticisms of the gospels are done from the perspective of a modern biographical viewpoint.  The ancients wrote biographies differently than those that are written today.  But this does not make them more or less true.  It is a matter of emphasis.  Today we want to know the details about dates, eye color, and a year by year accounting of events.  The ancients were more selective in their biographies, and often focused on character not a chronological ""play by play"" of a person's life.  The ancient biographers did not just write to catalogue facts about a person, they often wrote to demonstrate why or why not we should emulate their subject.  Moderns too have such motives, and even biases, but they are often less up front about them.  In many ways the ancients are superior in this regard, because it makes it easier to distinguish between data and commentary.    In the end, Burridge gives several examples of biography from the ancient world, and demonstrates that the Gospels very clearly match their pattern.  Though there is variety between each of the biographies and the Gospels, they are clearly demonstrated to be part of the same family of literature.  This then establishes how the Gospel writers understood their own works to be - biographies of Jesus",POS

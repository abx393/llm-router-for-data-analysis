I loved Gilad from watching him on ESPN and LOVE the beach scenes.  However, I felt like he went too fast; I was playing catch-up because he switched from one thing to another very quickly.  There weren't a lot of repeats before moving on to something new.  Maybe if I did it more and got used to it, I wouldn't mind.  However, I much prefer my Kathy Smith and Cathe videos.  This one is just collecting dust for me right now.  Maybe I'll give it a try another time, but I regret buying it",NEG

My father took me to see this movie when I was a child of about six or seven.  Actually, he wanted to see it and he had to take me along.  I didn't remember the plot, but I remembered the scenery and the music and the cool biplanes and dogfights.    So, I finally bought this movie so I could watch it as an adult.    I can empathize with those who say this movie is too long and moves too slowly.  That said, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.    The airplanes are amazing.  Where did they get all these biplanes from?  The only other movie I've seen that has such authentic looking biplane dogfights is ""Wings"", and that was made back in the 1920's when biplanes were all over the place.    The soundtrack by Jerry Goldmith fits the movie perfectly and adds mood where appropriate.    I loved the ""intermission"".   It reminded me of a time when a movie was a real event.  Movies were so long that the movie itself gave you a break to use the bathroom.  I saw this movie in a theater that was designed to allow perhaps a thousand people to watch a single movie on a huge screen, not some modern ""plex"" theater that has twelve little rooms where you can pay to see a movie with a bunch of strangers a few months before it's out on DVD.    So, it moves a little slowly by today's standards, but it's epic, and it's interesting to watch Peppard's character slowly alienate himself from his squadron, and his lover, so that at the end they kill him off by giving him the ""privelege"" of flying an experimental aircraft.",POS

Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the story. I've seen it in the cinema in the 80's and I still love it. But the issue why I gave low ratings is because of the DVD. This is the first time I've seen a DVD where the makers of it, puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie. Talk about advertising!    Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it ""digital transfer"" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording.    I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be.

I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it!

To be honest, I loved the Japanese original of this movie so much that my first watching of the American version was a little tainted. But I just watched the Richard Gere version again, this time on DVD, and found that I really like it more than I realized. Gere is so winsome (I'll pay to watch him dance any day, he is aging gorgeously!), and Lopez so elegant, and all the other characters so interesting, and the music so sexy, why quibble over which movie is better? This story is entertaining and touching in its own right, even if not as nuanced and heartfelt as the Japaese version. I have watched ballroom dancing competitions for years, and this film conveys the romance and excitement that draws people to those competitions. The story is charming, adult and PG with a  satisfying ending -- how rare is that combination these days? The DVD offers good insights into the ballroom training and hard work behind the movie, as well as a wonderful ""Sway"" music video. Which reminds me -- the soundtrack is excellent, and I bought that, too.",POS

Whether you're drawn to suave action heroes tossing out wry quips while emptying machine-guns into charging hoards, or of nearly wordless, hours-long existential explorations of meaningfulness and nothingness, ""I'm Not Scared"" will likely find in you a delighted new fan.    For the subtitle-phobic: take a risk!  ""I'm Not Scared"" is refreshingly original, quietly chilling, and continually surprising to the end.  The cast, led by 10 year-old Guiseppe Cristiano, is uniformly solid, and the Oscar-caliber photography is nothing short of brilliant.    The smart, effective score never gets overly dramatic nor does it tip the audience as to how it's ""supposed"" to feel. Its quiet beauty merely serves to support and bind the elements of the story, while standing humbly in the background.      I discovered this film quite by accident, having read no reviews, and now consider it to be my ""find"" of the year. I recommend ""I'm Not Scared"" without reserve or hesitation to anyone who ever wondered what his or her parents really did to make their money",POS

The first jurassic park was the best, but I still like some things about jurassic park iii better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, gladiator 2000,godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii. Sam niel really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii, dont grade it for an oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun.

The Anthology is a very good collection of 3 live shows from Bruce Dickinson's, pulled from many sources.  DVD ONE has Tattoo Millionaire tour live footage (DIVE DIVE DIVE), and Skunkworks Live. The DIVE video is poor quality shots, and the sound is not the greatest.  My favorite is the Skunkworks footage.  That album was probably the best of his first three solo albums in terms of musicianship and variation from maiden.  It's good to the footage done when it was still fresh, and laugh at Bruce trying to be ""alternative"".     Disc two is just Scream for Me Brazil in yet another package.  Good song set, playing Bruce's best solo work ever (Chemical Wedding Material), but it's too bad that the sound is poor and video is cut from video feeds from the crowd screens.  Pretty disapointing disc, could have been left out, made the package cost less, and no one would have missed it.  This keeps this DVD from getting 5 Stars       Disc three is the cool best part of this package.  The promo videos are just nice to have in one spot. The Tyranny of Souls promo video is interesting, and where else are you going to find the Samson footage.  All of the videos also have an intro option with bruce dickinson describing the story of each video (like knowing the ""Tatooed Millionaire"" video was directed by the pink floyd ""Learning to Fly"" directory...now the connection is made).  Nice job with the last disc.     Overall, I feel the skunkworks video and the Promo material are the best parts of this collection, and make it worth the 10 dollars I paid for this.  I would suggest to all to try an pay under 20 dollars for this collection, because the bulk of these DVD's is filler on disc two, and I would feel ripped off by it.

Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is a lawyer, that dislikes dogs, and even has a case against animal activist Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard). And he is up for accused of trying to torch the California headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate Grant & Strictland. And he doesn't much of a family life, since he is never home, and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie? His wife is Rebecca Douglas (Kristin Davis) and they have 2 children Josh (Spencer Breslin) and Carly (Zena Grey). And he has an appoontment to Josh's PTA meetings, and even through he is reminded at work, he forgets. Carly is not only a is both Forrester's student and a budding animal advocate herself, and her brother is trying out for football like his Dad, even through he secretly hates it, and didn't sign up for the fall musical. And then there is a mad scientist (Robert Downey Jr.), trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a Tibetan monastery. And Carly even kidnaps it from Grant & Strictland, and brings him home, nad even trouble starts when the dog bites Douglas, that gets him starting acting like a dog too, and even looking exactly like him at times. The movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old, which would be impossible, since neither dogs or people live that long, all I can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes, and this is one to avoid at all costs.",NEG

I was expecting a bit more from this movie, but I guess if I had really thought about it, anything starring Joan Crawford at this point in her life, and the always rebellious/troubled/angry John Garfield, could not have risen above what the film ended up being. My dislikes:  the music; often way too loud, way too much, very very annoying to me. Had to continually turn down the volume when the film went musical, which was much too often. Joan's character: well, she was middle aged, married, downing glass after glass of alcoholic beverages constantly, a chain smoker; no decent man would be attracted to that sort of woman. Well, John Garfield wasn't a decent man. I have yet to see a John Garfield role I liked...he always portrays characters who are angry and rebellious, self centered, going against life the wrong way. I didn't like him, I didn't like Joan, and so I didn't really care about them and ultimately the point of the movie. They had one of those uncomprehendable romances where seeminly they are deeply in love, yet they don't show it or speak it and you definitely don't feel it.  At the end, Joan was just over the top as a drama queen and by this time I was so fed up with this whole film I just kept saying, ""okay Joan, we know you are going to take your final swim so please just get on with it already so we can be finished with this boring and aggravating movie!"" But no, she had to walk at least 2 miles down the beach in her evening gown and high heels, and weep and weep, and make faces, and clutch her hair in despair, and on and on she went and all the while the loud music is playing out her ""sorrow and pain""! What a relief when it was  finally over! There are some films that leave me feeling very upset and agitated, and this was definitely one of them. What helped me get over it was to read some of the great reviews here on Amazon...some were so funny because they were so true about the stupidity of this movie that I laughed and laughed! Laughter is indeed a great healer!  I also did not go for the cynical piano player friend and his constant stream of one liners. Cynical humor isn't humor and it isn't funny; it's pathetic and sad. I am sure die hard Joan and John fans will always love this film, but all others should be able to see it for what it really is",NEG

This second sequel to ""Darkman"" maintains the visual style of the first two, has great music, a few good action moments, and a very good performance from Arnold Vosloo as the hero. These are the four things I liked most about ""Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die,"" which isn't a bad movie, but it's not very good either. I'm not only a fan of Darkman, I'm also a fan of Sam Raimi, Liam Neeson, and Arnold Vosloo. Given this, I was sad to see Raimi and Neeson leave the franchise, but am thankful for Vosloo's performance. He does a great Darkman/Westlake and the sequels, especially this movie, have him to thank. While the second was a great follow-up, this film is a little on the stupid side. Jeff Fahey, overacting in every scene, plays bad guy Peter Rooker, who is a drug dealer who is after Darkman when a large sum of money is stolen from him. The plot digs deeper into Rooker's life and soon Darkman is disguising himself as Rooker and befriends his wife and daughter. Darkman soon makes a vow that he will not get involved with the family, that he is only after Peter. But soon Darkman's light side gets the better of him. The movie is bleeding with predictable moments and painfully awful one-liners. Thankfully, director Bradford May keeps a dark, violent tone to the movie and mostly keeps the movie serious about itself. There are a few unintentionally funny moments, more so than in the second, and this hurts the movie a little. I suppose the reason to see this film is if you liked the first two. I did, and gladly added this one to my collection. I have no regrets about it, but take fair warning: only fans will enjoy this one. Everyone else will be in the dark",NEG

I really wanted to like this film.  It hurts not to recommend it, because the subject matter is extraordinary and compelling: a once-in-a-lifetime night in American theater that happened during the Great Depression.  And Tim Robbins' heart is in the right place.  But great intentions don't make a great film, and unfortunately, that's the case here.  Robbins tries to do a multiple-character loose plot that makes one think of Robert Altman.  In fact, watching Cradle Will Rock, you realize just how good Altman is, because he makes this sort of thing look so effortless (so much so that detractors have often accused him of ""not really directing"" his pictures).  Well, to quote the late senator Lloyd Bentsen: Tim Robbins, you're no Bob Altman.    The film has an impressive cast list.  Unfortunately, almost everyone overacts (or is overdirected by Robbins, since these actors have turned in other fine performances).  Particular violators are Cary Ewles as John Houseman and Angus Macfadyen as Orson Welles.  Both seem to channel Nathan Lane in their over-the-top elocution and both as directed by Robbins turn every showbiz cliche in the book, such as bickering pettily and then, when they reach an agreement over something, jumping up and down and shouting ""Eureka!"" while hugging.  Other hams include Ruben Blades as painter Diego Rivera and, surprisingly, the normally spot-on Susan Sarandon as Mussolini's art-living mistress.  (With her over-bearing accent she sounds more like Count Dracula's mistress.)  Other cliched characters include doe-eyed Emily Watson as a shy waif who never gets a break in life until, of course, the last scene.    There's also a strange sideplot involving Bill Murray (okay, he does not overact; *can* Bill Murray overact?) as a washed-up ventriloquist.  This started off promising, with him attending secret meetings sponsored by alienated conservatives who see the times changing in ways that make them uncomfortable, but it really went nowhere in my opinion.  Conversly, the third (third!) major plotline, about Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera to paint a mural in his new building, went predictably where we'd expect, and was way too drawn out in the film's ending.  Oddly, for a screenplay that cried out for lots of oddball, nonconformist characters, no lines and little face time are given Corina Katt Ayala as Frida Kahlo--who in real life was quite a character who could have been put to better use here.  Also underused is the always-reliable Bob Balaban.  Hank Azaria is okay as the playwright, but the whole surreal bits that happen whenever he has a scene to write or perform strike me as Robbins trying to be arty and ""profound.""    The one standout performance is by Cherry Jones, wonderful as Hallie Flanagan.  Her warm and very natural performance just throws into high relief how forced and phony most of the rest of the cast is.  Even here, though, Robbins misses the point.  The high moment comes when Balaban shakes her into reality after the Congressional hearings and tells her ""It's over.""  That could have been the beginning of a big dramatic scene, but Robbins glosses over it for a phony and smug mock-interrogation in the court chambers--preaching to us like we're third graders who can't be trusted to figure it out ourselves.  Similarly, the walk down the street to the second theater that begins the climax could have been a big dramatic moment--what will be the fate of this controversial play, and the actors who have rehearsed it for months?  Instead Robbins gives us a victory dance before the victory--a parade of jugglers, acrobats and cha-cha dancers set to comical klezmer music that undermines what he's just set up.  We feel a satisfaction and--I hate to keep using this word but it's true--smugness, before the big night even happens.  And I'll leave it to you to decide the effectiveness--and the ultimate meaning--of the very last shot.  I still haven't decided if it works, but it was a bold idea.    Another big part of what sinks this movie is the hammy score.  It may seem piddling to talk about background music, but it really breaks the movie.  The music was done by David Robbins--Tim's brother.  Nepotism rears its ugly head.  Robbins' music is usually inappropriate--slapstick and overly broad like the rest of the film's elements, as though Robbins doesn't trust us to follow him and feels he has to drive home his message with power tools.  Yet despite the constant heavy-handedness, Cradle Will Rock never finds its tone--part history lesson, part ""serious drama,"" part broadsided ""comedy,"" it can't ultimately decide if it wants to hit you in the head with a hammer or in the face with a pie.  It tries both by the end, and neither works.    Ultimately, I felt like Robbins couldn't get a distance from his material.  He lectures us to the point that the word MESSAGE in bright red practically flashes on the screen.  Understatement is not in his bag of tricks.  It's not that I disagree with much of what he has to say, but he fairly hits you over the head with it, and acts as though he's the first one to show you upper-class hypocracy.  The one really interesting plot thread--about how the Hallie Flanagans of the world were called before the House UnAmerican Committee to defend their loyalty while the Hearsts of America appeased dictators by buying art from them (and thereby financing their fascism)--is the highlight of the film.  But even here Robbins stages a garish costume party to drive home the point and again whips out the power tools.  Tim, we get it.    Despite this negative review, the film might be interesting to see just for the fascinating history lesson that it is.  Or you could go online or to a library and find some nonfiction material on the subject matter.  I read somewhere that originally none other than Orson Welles himself was set to make this film, but the deal never got off the ground and then he died.  That's too bad.  I would like to have seen what he could have done with this material.  As it is, Robbins is too close to it--too loud, too preachy, too self-righteous--to pull it off.",NEG

If you are a fan of early SciFi movies, this is a must-have for your library. There are some classic shot sequences that have been honored in more recent films, and you should look for these. For example, Spielberg must be a big fan. Pay attention to the shot compositions for the field (fence, lighting, etc.) and seek out homages to be found in Close Encounters and War of the Worlds.    It is also highly informative to note the perspectives used for social mores, and for science in general. In today's world, the notion that ""the town scientist"" would turn his astonomical telescope into the daylight sky and view heavenly objects, then turn it below the horizontal and look across the countryside to view the goings on at a top secret military base, are both hoots. That the scientist sees a classic rocketship and knows simply by the form that it is ""atomic"", is classic. One can only imagine the wonder that science and the future held for the popular mind back then that the writers could get away with that kind of stuff.    And yet, in contrast, note the strong presentation of the female role, not as a nurse, but as a doctor who makes the initial tough decisions and takes charge of the situation, driving the story forward. Very progressive, when contrasted with the ""scientist love interest who exists to admire the brilliance, bravery and manhood of the hero"" found in the typical films of this genre and era. Admittedly, our heroine is subjected to those stereotypes later on in the story, which is disappointing.    I also love the military response. This is shortly after WWII. Because some kid has a bug up his tail, we roll the tanks onto the trains and storm the town. Commanding officers up on rooftops with binoculars!!    In summary, our modern levels of sophistication might diminish this film to Mystery Science Theater, but that would be unfair. Instead, I recommend watching it once for the sheer joy of it. Then, watch it a second time with a more critical eye and have all your laughs and pick out all your iconic scenes for future reference",POS

I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.    If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him",NEG

I'm not very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than Harry Potter. The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round.     The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but ""Lemony Snicket..."" entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!).     There's a lot of CGI here but not to the point to annoy you, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performance to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles. The great cast is completed with respectable names (Luiz Guzmï¿½n, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, Cedric the Entertainer...) in small roles. Sublime film.    It's funny, it's interesting, it's creative! I recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art, if you like Jim Carrey, and if you like unique plots, highly recommended for all type of audiences!",POS

I saw this movie in the theater and still don't really know what it's actually about. I have to say though, that if you rank this ""film"" as a comedy, then it deserves 5 stars, sadly, I'm pretty certain that Uwe Boll didn't mean it as such (though i'm sure he would say otherwise). Despite this movie being as bad as it is, I have to say that it made for one of the best movie going experiences that I have ever had, the consesus of the viewing audience was that this movie was so bad, that noone minded one bit when everyone in the theater started heckling it out loud in Mystery Science Theater fashion. The movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like  ""don't be insane!"" and virtually every word to come out of Tara Reid's mouth, but the best part came when one of the characters called out for their lost friend Marco and literally 5 people, including myself, couldn't resist the urge to yell ""polo"" at the screen. This is one of those movies that's so unbelieveably bad that it borders on being art (if you consider taking a dump on a puppy artistic expression that is). It amazes me that there are people out there that may actually like this movie, I can't think of a single use for it, though I can honestly say that if a copy of this film were found in Sadam Huisein's palace during operation Iraqi freedom, then it certainly justifies going to war and is proof that Saddam had at least one weapon of mass distruction",NEG

The first season of Seaview was the best and Season 1, Volume 2 has some of the series best episodes.  Mutiny, Doomsday, The Invaders, The Indestructible Man, The Buccaneer, The Human Computer, The Saboteur, Cradle of the Deep, and The Enemies are top-notch.  I've always loved Seaview's incredible monsters and Mutiny's giant jellyfish is a sight to behold.  The threat of nuclear war is realistically portrayed in Doomsday.  I still get shivers up and down my spine when Robert Duvall opens his eyes in The Invaders and when the robot stalks Patterson and Kowalski in The Indestructible Man.  Only Seaview would have an episode about someone bold enough to steal the Mona Lisa.  This story (The Buccaneer) works because the villian is believable (a touch gay by today's standards but that's why the story works) and the relationships between the crew members are emphasized.  In The Human Computer, Seaview is controlled by a computer that's supposed to replace the crew.  Star Trek did a similar story but Seaview's is better because only Crane and an enemy agent are on board and the sight of these 2 men stalking each other on the deserted sub have great impact.  By far the best episode for me is The Enemies.  With it's crazy cold war politics, Crane and Nelson against the bad guys, and that wonderful room where people on one side seem gigantic compared to those on the other side, how could this episode miss.  As always, the special effects, the black and white photography, and Paul Sawtell's wonderful theme make Seaview one old series that's worth visiting over and over again",POS

The Labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy.  This has always been one of my favorite films, and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more.  Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work).  Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin.  Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey.  The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people.  The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen.    The film is supplemented on this DVD with a ""Making-of"" documentary - an original feature, narrated largely by Jim Henson himself - made during the actual production of the film (released in 1986).  Such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are - what goes into their creation, how they operate, and how they interact with the sets and other characters (especially in this case with the live actors).  It's a lot of fun to see this ""inside"" look, and more than anything gives a real sense of who Jim Henson was and how much this all really meant to him.  My favorite quote from Jim Henson in this documentary was when he said (about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie), ""When I go see a film, when I leave the theater... I like to be happier than I was when when I went in, I like to leave with an up feeling, and I like a picture to have a sense of substance, to be about life and the things that matter to me,"" - a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age.    Lighthearted, fun, fantastical, funny, beautiful, exciting, and more ""real"" than many of today's ""realities"" - extremely enjoyable and uplifting.  As an added bonus, Monty Python member Terry Jones wrote the script (and is interviewed in the documentary).  Cheryl McFadden (Star Trek: TNG's Beverly Crusher) also did all the choreography in the film (for both humans and puppets). :-",POS

He'll be here very shortly."" . Henri-Georges Clouzot's ""Diabolique"" is a film that falls short of its potential.  Its rather routine resolution undermines its brilliant premise, suffocating atmosphere, and top-notch acting.       Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) conspire to murder Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), the director of a boarding school.  Christina is Michel's wife and Nicole is his mistress.  Both are frequent victims of his abusive nature.  The two women carry out their plan perfectly but Michel's body disappears soon after they dispose of it.  Even more troubling to Christina and Nicole is that subsequent developments suggest that the murdered man might still be alive.       ""Diabolique"" is graced with three outstanding performances.  Meurisse is effectively slimy as the subject of the murderers' ire while Clouzot and Signoret are superb as the oddly-matched killers.  The film also does a wonderful job of keeping the viewer in suspense once Michel's body disappears.  However, the payoff at the end is not worth all the time the viewer has invested in the film.  The ending is not clever, shocking, or surprising.  It is just plain disappointing.  Too put it simply, ""Diabolique"" is one of those films that runs out of gas before it crosses the finish line.",NEG

Face Off is in my opinion an all time classic film, the plot at first glance is fairly ridiculous and unrealistic but it is one of those cases where if you suspend your disbelief you will love this film.  John Travolta plays Sean Archer a police detective whose son was accidently killed by Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) while attempting to kill Archer, who had been tracking him for several years.  Archer then makes it his lifes ambition to catch Troy, and early in the film Archer finally catches and apparently kills his man (Troy is in a deep coma afterwards), only after he reveals vague details of a chemical attack on L.A.  After interviewing his brother Pollux Troy, they find out there is indeed an attack iminent in L.A, but he will give no details of the location.  It is then that the undercover Face swap idea is suggested, from this point on Archer is played superbly by Nicholas Cage, who goes into prison to recover info from Pollux.    The plot dramatically changes when Troy awakes fom his Coma, after finding a video of the operation and finding his face missing, he calls in a few associates to help him.  The doctor who performed the operation on Archer then grafts his face onto Troy at gunpoint, the few people who knew about the top secret mission are then all killed.  From this point on of course Castor Troy is played by Travolta.  I won't give away any more of the plot but what follows is both hilarious and disturbing, both leading men are superb, but Cage perhaps just steals the show, as he gradually becomes trapped in Troy's body (as Archer).  A great plot, an all star cast and superb acting make this action thriller a classic, like most great action films, there are great high budget chase scenes, hilarious moments (usually courtesy of Travolta as Castor Troy) and excellent drama.  Instead of ridiculing the plot, watch this with an open mind and you will see a superb action film, which I believe to be one of the best of all time",POS

If some one had told me this film would turn into a story of an actual war between nations, I would have watched it sooner. The reviews I had read for it made it sound like a rip-off of Akira, and the first hour or so makes you think it just might be it.    A group of friends who are in a sort of Xtreme motorcycle sport find themselves in the middle of their nation Aphrodia invaded by the nation of their enemy Ishtar. They quickly find themselves under military rule, and have to deal with life changing in such a time period. The group eventually decides to do some guerilla action and attack an enemy tank that is always in their stadium.     Then, just as the tank is destroyed and reinforcements are coming up, and the hero is about to be run over...a Free IO soldier fires a missile into the Octo and destroys it.    Then the movie becomes a story of a nation fighting for their freedom, as the group joins the free soldiers who are fighting Ishtar all the way back out of IO. Eventually the hero, at first sympathetic, is convinced to join forces. The final battle takes place in the capital of IO, and what a climax it is.    Overall, the film boasts fine animation and retro 80's anime design. The action is well done and the mecha designs even better, and the storyline is also exceptionally well done. You get a good sense of a population under foreign rule, and its good to see an anime exploring such depths. Also, the politics of a nation in exile fighting for their return is equally unique. Maybe its because I'm a political nut, but I found it all interesting.    If I had known I would have enjoyed this film, I would have watched it far sooner than I did.

I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:    First, very little is true to the book.  That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say ""That's not in the book...that's not in the book...""    Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.       I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...     A kid chasing a ticket through a train,     A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,     A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,    (Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)    OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...    A train sliding out of control on the ice,    A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,    A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the ""coaster tycoon"" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole.     Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...    A train car running out of control through Santa's village,    Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...    Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.    At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!      And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.    So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a ""character driven"" story is, this is the opposite.

My watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world. The premise of the film was disturbing to say the least. I have never been a true fan of Charleton Heston who in my opinion always has overacted. However, Edward G. Robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played. His performance was truly heartfelt, bringing to mind the current debate on ""ending one's own life with dignity"". I shutter to think that this is life as it should be though. But Robinson's character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him. I found the other actors to be somewhat bland. Perhaps this was acting at that point in time, but some actors can make the most of roles and others cannot. The story line was unique, but the script was lacking. A re-make today by Steven Spielberg might be worthwhile seeing. Perhaps the most striking element I took from this film was an unshakeable chilling and unsettling feeling that this could very well be our world if we do not wake up",POS

Cheap Trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today.  They have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age!  What other band sounds better 30 years later?    After my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly.  Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out.  And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there's a great build up to the climax of each song.    However, what's really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song.  NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY.  It's like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show.  The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc.      The closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs.  That's exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show.    Bonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety.    Perhaps someday we'll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD.

I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.      The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player.  Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics.    At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so.  The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater.  In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice.  It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love.  The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly.  They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie.      I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone.      On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  There are no deleted scenes.  This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college.  I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony.  I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more.

In the mid to late 1970s, disco music was king and everyone enjoyed going to the clubs and dancing the night away.  In this story of New York's world-famous Studio 54, the story is told through the eyes of Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), a young man from New Jersey who manages to get onto the guest list and into the very exclusive club.  A gas station attendant by day, Shane soon finds himself as one of the regulars and manages to secure himself a job at the club as a bus boy/bartender.    Shane befriends two of the club's workers, Greg Randazzo (Brechin Meyer) and his wife Anita (Salma Hayek).  They invite Shane to move in to their apartment, but Greg soon suspects that Shane and Anita are having an affair.  Shane actually has fallen for Julie Black (Neve Campbell), another regular.  A soap opera star, Shane is intrigued by her beauty and is immediately drawn to her.  After a while, the two begin a relationship.    Meanwhile, Steve Rubell, played magnificently by Mike Myers, has been laundering money from the club.  Each night, he sends bags full of money out with the trash to be picked up and taken away, out of sight of the I.R.S.  This scam goes on for quite some time until finally the I.R.S. finds out about Rubell's operation and raids the club.    Shane, spurned in the end by Julie, eventually leaves 54 to become a college student and restaurant manager.  Steve Rubell is sentenced to 18 months in prison and is forced to sell 54 in a plea agreement. He is allowed to remain as a ""consultant"" to the new ownership, and he also throws a big party at the club's re-opening, attended by Shane, Greg, and Anita.    Studio 54 was indeed the king of the discos.  Celebrities from all over the world, including Andy Warhol and Truman Capote, were regular visitors to the club.  The music was loud, and sex and drugs were freely available. Unfortunately, 54 never really regained its prominence after its re-opening, and it closed down for good in 1986.  Steve Rubell died in 1989 at age 45.      This movie does an excellent job of showcasing the very famous club, right down to the throngs of people who begged to get in each night.  The acting in the film is very good, but Mike Myers stands out above the rest.  His superb portrayal of the eccentric but troubled Steve Rubell is the highlight of the film.    Having grown up in the 70s, I remember reading about Studio 54 and what a fantastic place it was.  This movie shows both the bright and dark sides of the famous disco.  I recommend this movie highly.  If you're a child of the 70s like me, then you'll remember the disco music and the almost surreal essence that 54 had.  Watch this movie and enjoy a trip back to when disco ruled and 54 was the place everyone wanted to go",POS

Antzcak's direction is inexplicable and the film is weighed down by a directionless, melodramatic script and technical shortcomings. The ADR (dialog overdubbing) is incompetent and terribly distracting, making the film sound like a radio drama recorded in a basement; all the more odd considering that in all other respects the project seems well-funded and professional -- great sets, superior costuming and impeccable lighting. The gorgeous cinematography is brutalized by a directorial style characterized by long, tedious dialog punctuated by frenetic, fast-cut flashback and dream sequences that contribute neither to our understanding of Chopin's character nor the events driving the plot forward. Non-sequiturs abound; Antzcak seems to have been attempting to create a mood piece to accompany the brilliant musical performances, rather than a sustained narrative. But the only moods sustained are bewilderment and boredom.    Chopin comes off as a selfish boor of a prima dona; perhaps historically acurate, but hardly compelling on screen. What does it say about this movie that, in a crucial scene where a wagon carrying Chopin nearly topples over a precipice, you find yourself rooting for the precipice?    Unlike the vastly superior Amedeus or the merely pedestrian Immortal Beloved, you learn nothing about the connection between the composer's life and his music. Antzack seems singularly uninterested in the historical signifigance of Chopin's acheivement, the nature of his talent's development, his freindship/rivalry with Liszt, or the musical environment of the day. Desire for Love actually has more in common with a film like Jules et Jim, in that it dwells on the inner dynamics of a doomed and disfunctional romance; unfortunately the characters aren't one tenth as compelling or sympathetic.    Desire for Love ends with the composer's protracted death, like Amadeus and Immortal Beloved did with Mozart and Beethoven, respectively. But it fails to evoke the tragic mood of the latter two; the film itself seems infected by a consumptive, cinematic analog of the protagonist's malaise, eating itself from within and finally wheezing to a merciful termination",NEG

Maybe they'll go ahead with Insane, and just include the Tribunal episode in its own 14 episode release, if this one sells good, that is.  I don't see why they couldn't up the ep content to 15 and just go ahead and give us both.  But check the tmnt website for that press release if you're interested.  And looks like the price is pretty low too.  An excelent buy.  But your guess on that 14th ep is as good as mine, folks.  Maybe as the sept 12 release date draws nearer, someone can confirm the last episode we're getting.  Oh and I forgot Samurai Tourists.         Maybe they'll go ahead and give us Insane in the Membrane because it fits better in the story arc from season four.  And hopefully, we'll get Ninja Tribunal plus the 13 episodes that complete that arc at a later date.  Maybe by Christmas?  I hope so, anyway.         And do I really need to give a plot synopsis of the latter part of season four?  Well, I think I will anyway.  But if you're lookin for spoilers, you won't find them here.         Leonardo is still filled with anger due to his defeat at the hands of Shredder and Karai last season.  And after a few adventures in which he nearly loses control, Splinter sends him to Japan to find himself with the help of Yoshi's old master, the ancient one.  But while Leo is gone, a new Shredder suddenly attacks the turtles, and Leo must return home and do battle with this new foe.  Well, maybe not a new foe, but a foe with an attitude ajustment though.         Also in this portion of the season, slime from agent Bishop's alien creations which has seaped down into the sewers(see Aliens among us from Vol. 3.7: Hun on the Run) has mutated several animals near the turtles' home.  Its up to them to end this outbreak, but one of them is infected by one of the creatures, causing him to experience a second mutation into a mindless beast.  Now the turtles must make a deal with the devil, so to speak, in order to have their brother restored.  Agent Bishop SAYS he has a cure.  But in order for Bishop to administer it, our heros must steal a valuable object for him.  They must invade the stronghold of the new Shredder and steal the Heart of Tengu, but there are darker forces at work here.  Even Bishop doesn't comprehend the evil that will soon be unleashed upon the world.         So save up your cash and get ready for this interesting dvd release in September!",POS

For a 2-disc, director's cut, my expectations were perhaps too high for this DVD.  Nevertheless, I was appalled at the poor quality of the transfer.  The colors were dull throughout, and focus was frequently not at the beginning of scenes.      For the movie itself, I don't agree that it is holding up well over time.  At 25 years old, the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who aren't waiting for their beloved canceled TV series to be on the big screen.    There's no question that II and IV are the best of the series, but comparing it to other Star Trek original cast movies isn't putting the bar very high.    My interest in watching this again was just having finished Melville's Moby Dick, the final scenes of which Khan repeats liberally during the final space battle.  That said, I think Montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed Khan and very evocative of Ahab.  However, Shatner's pretentious Kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on.  The original cast schtick just doesn't make for a compelling drama",NEG

This movie was pretty awful. Since I am ranking it with 1 star, then according to another reviewer I must not have a soul. Hey, it doesn't feel bad!    This movie has the worst black stereotyping of any of movie I have ever seen, particularly in a sci-fi movie. It is worse than the blaxploitation films of the 70's, which were at least entertaining.    This movie is about a group of teenage white kids, with one token black thrown in just for the hell of it. ""But just how 'black' is he?,"" you may be wondering. Well the movie makes it clear that he's a true soul man because it goes out of its way to establish these facts:    1. He talks different from the whites. (""Hey Bodee."" ""His name's Bodhi!"" ""Well you say it your way, and I'll say it mine."" Or something to that effect.)    2. He breakdances. (And we all know that all black people can breakdance, can't they?)    3. He likes basketball. (Again, every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it, right?)    4. He raps. (Because a person isn't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop, can they?)    I'm a white guy. And I'm not overly sensitive to racism issues. But watching this movie really surprised me. I was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype. I can't say that it's a good thing. It is quite embarassing to watch, actually. What where they thinking? This movie would never have been made that way in today's day and age.      The movie itself is pretty lame. It was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the 80's. It has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days. It also features a funky little ball named Bodhi. It is the weirdest, most nonsensical story I have ever watched. It is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up, which was later worked into a screenplay.    This movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch. The only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as Jason Patric (The Lost Boys) and Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys, Twister, Still Standing). It is also nice to see Richard Jordan (Logan's Run), as well as the stunning Sarah Douglas (Superman II, Conan the Destroyer) starring in a villainess roll, as usual.     Sarah Douglas really does make a good villain, too. It's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie. ""Sphere of longiness""? Ech!    I don't understand all you people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I mean, what are you thinking? It has to be just the ""I love the 80's"" nostalgia-factor kicking in. I don't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon.    And please. Skating on an overgrown road? Skating in the dirt? They'd get about 10 feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying. It might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand.    I'd have to say, that other dystopian future skating flick, ""Prayer of the Rollerboys"" is a much better movie than this. Of course that ain't saying much, because that movie pretty much stinks too.    Buy something else. ANYTHING else. If not for yourself, then at least to show the black people of the world a little basic human respect",NEG

I was immensely disappointed by this film. The ""avant-garde"" style of the film has been done better by other filmmakers (specifically Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger, and Harmony Korine), and the film is mostly about Jonathan, not about his mother. The critics made this film sound like it was an attempt by Jonathan to bring him closer to his mother, to try and understand her by making a film about her, and to bring ""closure"" to their relationship. Well, the film isn't really about Jonathan's mother, it's strictly about him. We hear and see tons of information (with annoying title cards) about Jonathan's life, career, and loves. It feels like an episode of ""this is Jonathan's life"", as if Jonathan is this absolutely fascinating, brilliant individual that we must all pay attention to. He may become a great artist someday, but he isn't there yet. Jonathan uses his mother merely as an excuse to make a very self-indulgent, narcissitic film about himself. He doesn't really seem interested in her, other than as an excuse to show how much HE'S suffered, not really about her suffering. While Jonathan had a horrendous childhood, I felt very little sympathy towards him, as he is constantly mugging for the camera in a ""feel sorry for me, I'm gay and my mother is insane"" way. The man has been taping himself since he was in grammar school, so he's just a tad in love with himself, methinks. Harmony Korine's julien donkey-boy is a film that deals with a schizophernic, and it is much more interesting and artistic than this film (Korine's uncle is a schizophernic). Derek Jarman shot his films in multiple formats similar to this film, like 35mm, 16mm, video, and super8, and weaved the images into an artistic and fascinating tapestry. Kenneth Anger, as well as Jarman, infused a gay sensibility into their films, which Jonathan doesn't do very well. Overall, disappointing, considering critics said it was absolutely brilliant....",NEG

Until It's Time To Not Be Nice.""  (""Road House:""  Special Edition) . It's been said before (and over and over in all the reviews here, so I won't bore you with the details why it's been said) but I'll say it again:  ""Roadhouse"" is a great bad movie!  I do find it funny that this one has earned that type of fond recollection by so many and turned into a cult hit of sorts because of it; while there are literally tons of these type of movies that littered the action/adventure landscape throughout the 80s and early 90s.  Hardly any of them are even remembered much less revered to the extent ""Roadhouse"" is.  I guess it's just one of those things.  Maybe its because the movie has (at the time) bigger stars, a bigger budget and a larger abundance of gratuitous T&A than most theatrically released action flicks that bare a general resemblance to it (of course, you could find plenty of this type of thing lining the walls of your local Blockbuster, but even though they supply the action and nudity, they don't often supply the big stars and big budgets).  Maybe it was just a matter of right place, right time, right amount of exposure, etc.    Who knows; but whatever the reason, I'm glad enough this film has endured.      This special edition does its legacy as a winking-joke-unto-itself proud (Swayze's character is known as ""the best bouncer in the business.""  Where was the annual bouncer convention of  '89 held and how is the winner of that title determined?).  The best reason to pick this up instead of the previous, bare-bones DVD transfer is the commentary tracks.  The first is by the film's director, Rowdy Herrington, which is actually rather informative considering the source material being examined.  But the real treat is the other commentary track by director and professional fanboy Kevin Smith and his production partner Scott Mossier.  Not only is it a great commentary, but the very idea that the producers of this DVD saw it appropriate to include a commentary from someone who has nothing to do with making this movie shows that all involved are in on the joke.  They should have just gone the full nine and held contest to find the ultimate, die hard ""Roadhouse"" fan and let him/her do the commentary.  And I'd be willing to bet, somewhere, Quentin Tarrentino is pissed he didn't get a call (he loves contributing his two cents to cult films that he has nothing to do with other than being  either a huge fan or hating the movie's guts - either way, always an entertaining commentator).      Now if only studio execs would get off their butts and release perhaps the only junk-action movie more loved and clamored for than this one:  ""Stone Cold.""  (It feels like that is the only movie ever made that has not made it to DVD, yet everyone seems to want it to be released, so what gives?!  Since when aren't studios egger to cash in???)  Give us a ""Stone Cold"" special edition and slap it in a two-pack with this classic and you'll have all the craptacular entertainment this side of the old school Steven Seagal flicks you'll ever need.",POS

I recall first watching this movie with my ex-friend and I took a trip down the coast. I wasn't really expecting much, pretty much just another slapstick, stupid comedy. But to be totally honest, this movie is really awesome! ""Hotshots,"" ought to have you rolling around the floor in some instances. But first, a look at the ""storyline.""    Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is the son of a famous air ace who died um...tragically in an F-15 crash landing and a terrible mix-up regarding moose hunting season. He decides to follow in his father's footsteps and become a flying wonder. This briefly sums up the main ""story,"" but there are many other smaller stories including that of Pete 'Dead Meat' Thompson (William O'Leary) and Jim 'Wash Out' Pfaffenbach (Jon Cryer) who fights his own personal war against the terrible ailment of Wall Eye Vision. That aside, Topper Harley must find out what really happened to his dad and help both his friends and himself to achieve their dreams, even if it goes to ridiculous proportions.    You may think that this is a movie that merely takes the piss out of movies like ""Top Gun,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Kickboxer,"" but...well, you're right. But the satire is clever (yet decidedly idiotic), and it certainly succeeds in making just about everything totally ridiculous. Don't expect realism, objectivenes and logic in this movie - that's not the point of it. It's there as a satire, and really is a classic satirical film of the 1990's. The appeal of ""Hotshots"" is the sheer stupidity and absurdity of many of the events that take place in the movie, and of course, if you've watched the movies that are being ripped off, you'll really laugh your head off.    The best character has to be Adm. Thomas 'Tug' Benson (Lloyd Bridges). He performs the role of a supposedly ""hardened"" war-veteran and a man who has seen much conflict with great gusto. It just goes to show that some vets get more violent, others more angry, some sad - and Benson just gets dumber. He's even better in the sequel, which is surprisingly better than the original (Hence the reason why this only gets 4.5 stars.)    All in all, ""Hotshots,"" is a moronic, silly, yet extremely funny and witty slapstick comedy. If you like Monty Python style humour or just love classic slapstick, this movie is undoubtedly for you. Otherwise, if you like intelligent comedy, stay the hell away from ""Hotshots."" It's not meant to be intelligent, so remember that. But at the end of it all, it'll always be a classic slapstick, silly comedy! Buy it, rent it, steal it today",POS

I wish I came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie, we own the original (non 3D version) and she knew the 3D version was the same movie but was excited about the 3D aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it.      We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...    Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.    Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release",NEG

Now, there was some latin dancing, some disco dancing, and a boogie/hip hop cool down, but nothing to break a sweat with.    I would recommend this for someone who is just beginning to work out, or someone out of shape.I was really disappointed, because it was hosted by Allie DelRio, in my humble opinion the best of the best. Her smile was wonderful, following her was easy, but it just lacked that FIRM energy. Plus, the workout cast had only Allie and Allison. The other folks were people never before seen in FIRM videos. One lady in the back even did these mini-dip twist things with her knees over her toe box!

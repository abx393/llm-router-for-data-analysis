A neighbor of my friends called them on me and claimed that I was parked in her spot.  I was not-- my friends have two spots, and I was parked in one of them.  The driver essentially threatened my friend whose spot it was, and when I told him all I had to get the car down was $42, he told me to 'dig deeper'.  He told my friend, who is one of the most gentlemanly people I know, to step away from the car because he was being 'a smart guy'...not true at all.  Then, he threatened to drive away, making me pay the whole $129.  Finally we came up with $50 total and he skeptically counted it and drove away.

To begin with, our hostess was friendly and accommodating.  Our server was easy going, also friendly, and helpful.  The decor felt like a mix of retro and Asian influences.  We were a party of four and had the cripsy spring rolls and braised pork belly buns, which were fun and tasty!  We also had the dumplings (our favorite dish!), the chicken udon noodles that were a bit spicy but very good, and the chicken wings (good), plus sides of rice.  The drinks (mine a Lotus Flower--delicious!) were creative and yummy.  And then for dessert we had the coconut cream pie and the vanilla bean parfait, both of which we felt like we could have done without...neither wowed us.   I would definitely return, since it was a fun environment with good food and decent prices, but some of the others in my group did not feel that way.

I walked into this place around 5:30p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the store.  I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didnt drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didnt help at all so I dont know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didnt like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they dont care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, 'you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket' and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.  Its obvious the workers dont want to be there.  Stay away from this store and Sprint",negative

We were out all day, and busy so we were starving! We picked up our pizzas and drove home which isn't to far about 10 minutes away. Anyways when we got home, I took a bite out of the hand pan pizza and it was completely raw!!! The dough wasn't even cooked, and I almost gagged! How in the world can someone give their customer an undercooked raw pizza! It's just awful! So naturally we called to let them know about the situation and asked if they could deliver the new pizzas to us, since it was their fault for messing up in the first place! Well long story short, they said they wouldn't because they did not deliver to our address, even though it was literally 10 minutes down the road in the next city over! So my husband decided he would just go grab the new pizzas...Well 30 minutes later my husband comes home with the new pizzas and guess what.....they were undercooked and RAW!!!! At this point I was just fed up, so I called dominos back, and told them they once again sold me undercooked pizzas...so the girl on the phone puts her manager on the phone, and I explained the situation. The manager then tells me she personally made the pizza and if she kept it in the oven any longer it would have burned! I told her well then you need to be re-taught how to make a pan pizza because what they should be doing to avoid it from burning the toppings or being undercooked is putting the dough in alone to cook a bit and then taking it out adding the toppings and putting it back in to cook! Clearly dominos needs to retrain these employees at this location! Anyways point to this story is my husband had to go back a third time for new pizza! While the other pizzas got cold! They didn't even want to credit us for the pizzas but they made sure we brought the other undercooked pizzas back! Like seriously they make me laugh!!! What are they going to do resell the pizza that should be trashed? What a joke! Needless to say, I contacted corporate and I hope they take this matter seriously because as a customer and for this huge inconvience they should do something! Anyways do not go to this location unless you want raw dough for your meal!",negative

This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I'm pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I don't know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager. Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent $50 on such a disappointing experience.",negative

This one I must say was pretty bad. We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. Our server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.After we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.After waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. After another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.Within the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.She ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock. Not acceptable. I've never given any server under 10% for service even if it was pretty bad until now. If I do decide to go back to Hooters it will not be for a very long time.",negative

I ordered a coffee and it came hot instead of iced and I politely asked if I can have it iced. The rude  barista tells me that it costs $5 and he won't make it again... Yes I know it costs $5 because I already paid for it asshole! Then he paid a big deal when I asked him to give me a cup with ice after he refuses to make me another drink. Such a simple request in my part didn't deserve such attitude. Please learn about good customer service especially when one is paying so much for a watered down drink at best.

The couple seated behind us were having a similar experience and at least provided us with some comic relief. It took about 15 min for our server to bring menus but when se did, she apologized. She took our order, didn't write anything down then came back and asked us what we ordered again. She brought 2 waters even though my boyfriend had asked for iced tea, about 15 minutes later brought our salads then came BACK and asked what we were waiting on so she could look out for it. Our 2 slices of pizza came another 15 minutes later like warm and not very flavorful. The couple behind us had to refill their own drinks and go searching for silver wear. After finishing our food and not being brought our check we went to the counter to pay, where the server had to wait for another woman to finish taking to-go orders and helping customers before she could get change for us.

They really do vegan right. Its really all about the sauces & seasonings. Im ok in the kitchen, but Id love to be able to make flavors like they do. I hardly ever leave a restaurant without thinking, 'I coulda made that better at home.' But not here. It would take a lot to learn how to work spices, herbs & sauces like they do!

I called 20 minutes before to see if they accepted walk ins and was told by the gentleman who answered the phones they did so I took the drive to the salon.

It wasnt busy when I arrived with my friend, and when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. We stood there for a few minutes before the hostess walked up, and just looked at us until we spoke up that we needed a table for two.

I ordered the steak and Migas Benedict and my friend ordered the crab cake Benedict. Our food was cold for the most part. When we finished eating, we sat for over 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged.  The bartender failed to even glance at us and she made herself busy acknowledging everyone else who came up to the bar and completed drink orders. If anything, it felt like she was avoiding us. I understand that it may be understaffed but it takes two seconds to ask how everything is going. After waiting, she finally said 'Ill be right with you.' It took her another 5 minutes to be 'right with us.' She then proceeded to print the check without asking us if we wanted anything else, which to us made it seem like we were being kicked out, feeling even more unwelcome than before. The food was mediocre for the price that we paid. For a nice and pricey cafe, the staff was very rude.

I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place.

Looks like Im too late, since they are closing at the end of the month. I have never encountered a bike shop so bad that I truly wished they would cease to do business, but this place came pretty close. I came in a few times, and each time, the owner made it abundantly clear that he did not give a **** that I was in his shop. On top of that, he didnt have some items that any shop should have (irrelevant now, but had no 26' rim strip and had just 2 motley saddles). Ive worked in a shop before, and customers are the lifeblood of the shop - bummer this guy didnt realize that and ran a lousy shop that went under.",negative

This time was no different.I chose this spot from Grub Hub delivery.  My delivery options are quite limited in the new neighborhood so I couldnt believe my luck as I read the menu for this place.  I thought I must be dreaming as I read all of the delicious sounding items, and I triple checked to make sure they delivered.  Reasonably priced, and they were open. Great!  I place my order.  2 hours later, no food.  I call, and a young lady says that its coming up now. Wth??! After I protest, she offers me a lemonade. Blank stare. Go figure.  Finally, about 20 minutes later, food arrives.Heres the kicker- the food was actually GOOD.  The breakfast potatoes I got were downright DELICIOUSLY spicy and tasty, with the bell peppers and onions perfectly grilled.  I had ordered a turkey and cheese with EXTRA mayo, lettuce, tomato, and ONION, CUT in HALF. They sent a sandwich with NO mayo and not cut.  I am very picky, hence the reason I take the time to very carefully specify how I would like my food prepared.  When it is nothing like I ordered, it signifies to me that I am not important enough for you to even care about TRYING to prepare my meal the way I asked (and paid) you to do it. FAIL.Turns out, the sandwich was very good, the bread was perfectly soft, but the lack of care in preparation means Ill NEVER have another one.  Plus, had I not had Hellmans in the fridge, we would have had a REAL problem, as I dont do sandwiches with no mayo. Period.The owner called me when Grub Hub called her, and explained that she is a 'full service' restaurant, and she does the delivery orders 'when she can fit them in'. Had this been my establishment, I would have comped this entire meal for goodwill, and offered to try and get it right on a different day, thus ensuring a second visit from a first time patron/new neighbor/potential regular (I eat out 6 of 7 days a week, most unfortunately).  Oh well.  Not my business.  I will offer this:  if you dont have the capacity to do delivery service, then you should not try to do delivery service.Good luck to you.",negative

Only one friendly person, Carlos, at the front desk was great. Not one other friendly experience.  Bueno Vista Suites needs to provide their employees with customer service training or do a complete house cleaning except for Carlos and Tondra. The rooms are filthy.  Carpets have gross stains.  I couldnt bare to walk on the carpet barefoot,  It was so bad I laid a path of towels down to walk throughout the suite.  The plumbing was broken in the shower.  We reported it and asked if they could have it repaired while we were the parks, but we requested no maid room service.  The attendant not only was rude about it, he flat said NO we cant go in the room if you have the do not disturb sign on the door. We said ' well cant you make a note and document that we, as the guest, request no room service? Because we need plumbing repairs in the room? ' He said No.  At that point we had received such horrible service already my husband just told the man fine this is typical for the service we have received this entire stay at this hotel.  We proceeded to leave the hotel for the parks, Obviously upset and youd think the guy would reconsider and try to make it right, but no he let us walk right out knowing we have a plumbing issue that needed repair.  The issue was that the shower faucet flew off the wall while I was showing and hit my leg. That night and next day we had to shower in the tub with water shooting straight out of the wall from a copper pipe.  The shower head did not work.  We will make do as this will be our last night of a seven night. We missed breakfast.  I called room service for a pot of coffee.  I wait 30 it does not show up.  So i call to check on it.  Tondra who is very sweet said she has not record of room service.  She took my order for a pot of coffee and 15 minutes later I get coffee.  Five minutes after I get another knock at the door and its Tondra with coffee.  I tell her they just came.  She said how much did they charge you.  I told her it was 9.00.  She said it came from the hotel next door which buena vista also owns and that it why it took so long she said they should have told me.  They didnt .  Tondra assures me I will not get charged twice.  Tondra and Carlos were the only good things about this hotel.  There are so many hotels near Disney you have many choices.  I highly recommend you steer clear of this place.",negative

He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong.

A word of caution:  if you're planning on attending a show here in warm weather, you are gonna sweat your bawls off.   This venue is intimate not only with the artists, but also with your fellow audience members; you'll know soon enough who missed his Saturday bathing routine.Get here early so that you can score your seats of choice.  Be aware that some folks will come in later and get all uppity when you refuse to move.  I witnessed a couple of cutesy-wootsy college girls come in and try to giggle their way into seats together.  I explained to them that my arrival 45 minutes prior to the show was no accident, and I invited them to vacate my immediate surroundings, post-haste.  My fellow concertgoers cheered, and the lovely ladies departed, wide-eyed that someone could possibly have resisted their incredible charm, wit, and boobs.Go in cool weather, get there early, and go with a friend so that your seats can be defended while one of you runs up to one of the FULL BARS with DECENTLY PRICED drinks spread throughout the venue.",positive

I also told her that the color on my toes didn't math my fingers and she insisted it did.

He became rude and told me he would fix two finger nails (at minimum five were a mess). He also said he didn't care about my toes. I made an appointment to come back the next morning. When I got there the first woman had an attitude and told me my toes were not her problem. Then she got up and told me she would not do anything. Then the women who initially messed up sat down to do my nails... Unacceptable! I had to argue with the owner to get my toes and fingers done correctly. I was not mad at the initially employee, I just didn't want her to mess up again and I would've continued to go if I was handled appropriately.

I ended up finishing the entire bowl. Each table has  a chilli oil bottle, and a spice bottle as condiments if you choose to flavor up your food. The gyoza was a good balance between vegetables and meat, it was accompanied with soy sauce. It wasn't as flavorful as I would like it but it certainly wasn't bad. The takoyaki balls were good for their price--the presentation was beautiful. Each ball was stuffed with a generous amount of chopped octopus. I wish it was cooked a little longer for the inside was a bit too mushy for me, but don't get me wrong, with the sauces and bonito and seaweed flakes it was plenty flavorful. The environment was a very modern rustic, definitely great for a quick casual bite. The staff was nice but a bit more quiet than I'm use to for a ramen place.

I have this down to a science.  I am the chick that all sales reps eventually cower in fear from and pour themselves a stiff whiskey after selling | not selling me a car | truck | couch | designer purse | [insert purchasable item here].  Imagine my surprise when I move out here that in addition to no Dunkin Donuts and Chinese Food delivery at 3AM, Honda is a HAGGLE FREE ZONE. Simply unacceptable.  I pleaded with them to REDUCE THEIR PRICE.  Of course, there is HIDDEN MARKUP and stuff.  Take it down.  Do it NOW.  I NEED the satisfaction of knowing that I beat my sales rep to a quivering pulp of low price jelly with elaborate tactical accuracy..  Winning is what fuels me. Instead, they offered me this non-negotiable price.  I tried everything I could.  I plead.  I whined.  I walked out the door (and then I came back).  Nothing worked.  Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life.  My soul.Conclusion:  I don't like non-negotiable pricing.  Bleh.Point #2 - Prices are insane??Once upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership.   Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!Now buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  I am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.Kudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  Now I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  This was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.The showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.SummaryDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.

When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  Pros:The food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).Cons:The draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.

Their cocktails are great, they make them with heart and they are a buck or two cheaper than Woodsman, Tannery or Tabor Tavern. The bartenders are very, very sociable and nice - and they love talking about cocktails! This is a big plus in Portland where many with a bar like this are too snooty to chat. Even when it's slammed they are still friendly. Only con: they took their cocktail menu from about 60 drinks to around 20. Please bring back the big menu!Highly recommend!",positive

Most other hotels do not tell you that they are also going to charge you for parking, or a resort fee which comes as a surprise when you check in.

This is not the case at Drury Inn which not only does not charge you for these things, but also provides free internet, HBO, wifi, hot breakfast with all the fixings, and always very polite and helpful staff along with the cleanest facilities you will find around.

Until one day some friends suggested me meet there for dinner so when we look again the 'r' miraculously appeared. Even the exterior of the restaurant doesnt strike you as a gourmet pizza restaurant and bar but it is. The exterior can definitely pass for a health food store or even a health spa. We ordered four of the signature pizzas: Simple White, The Cure, Chicken Coup Deville and the I-95. These were all superb and 50% off on Mondays! I also tried their lamb sliders but as a lamb snob I much rather stick with traditional Greek and Turkish venues. We were a party of four and left with leftovers so the portions are reasonable. It also can accommodate larger parties along with outdoor seating.

We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. We call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying 'master of excellence'. Im sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesnt have physical space to display that.He tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN well talk price.Lets pause for a minute. Suppose youre a Honda dealer and you honestly dont have a relatively popular car. Wouldnt you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, dont you? Of course, you would. Either he didnt have a car or he knew he didnt want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.So he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess its working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didnt stop. He called me like 8 times and I didnt answer.We went to that other place the same day and bought the car. In summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Dont ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesnt mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply dont know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.Heres a more detailed account of our buying process: http://www.yelp.com/biz/silko-honda-raynham#hrid:k-v7aipcorfBAbBVzwWKcw",negative

Both times I got takeout and did not dine in.  I had fair service, but again I didn't dine in so I'm not expecting a lot.Cheese sticks: Fair.  Very run of the mill, nothing special about them.  I wouldn't order them again.Wings: Good wings.  I ordered them extra hot and they weren't particularly spicy, but they were cooked well and were meaty without being weird godzilla mutant chicken size.Pizza: So, I have a love-hate relationship with the pizza.  I ordered a large garlic, pepperoni and jalapeno pizza.  It's super floppy pizza so you need two hands to eat a slice.  It was freaking delicious, but it did not make my stomach happy and I spent a couple days on the toilet after eating half the thing.  I might gamble and try it one more time just to see if that's what really made me sick, but it tasted awesome, significantly better than chain pizza.",positive

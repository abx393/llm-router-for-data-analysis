The firat two visits were really very good.  We especially like(d) the BYOB with NO Corkage.  The food was fresh, interesting and well, maybe just seemed better because we just wanted it to be.\n\nThis evening's experience left us with a salty and disappointing taste.\nIt all started well.  We were very well attanded to by our server who came over and described the specials and explained the menu.  While she described the specials, she exclaimed that the \""""scallop entree was amazing\"""".  We ordered appetizers and she opened and poured our wine.\n\nAs she was getting ready to take our entree order, one of the other servers came over to our table and told her that they were out of the scallops and parmesan over pasta special.\n\nThree of us were truly disappointed as they were going to order this as their entree.  I amused that I'd be glad to go down to Giant Eagle to pick up the scallops if they still had the pasta, cream and cheese.  She retorted that \""""sorry, we're really out.  It's been a popular selection tonight.\""""  Having been so gloriously described as \""""amazing\"""", my wife and our friends (who were there on our recommendation and was their first visit to Aji) had to go back to the drawing board, adjust their taste bud profile, and choose something else which would, of course, never measure up.  \n\nThe appetizers came and we gladly devoured them in short order.  My wife and I had ordered the pork shank, and our friends had the chicken and the paella.  At about the time that our entrees came, we noticed that three young and attractive women were being seated a few tables away.  We noticed them because they were indeed attractive and they proceeded to take a number of pictures of one another and as a group.\n\nWe picked at our entrees for a while and none were particularily outstanding.  In fact, we all took over half our meals home.  When our server came over to take away the leftover food, my eyes looked at her and then were diverted beyond her to the table containing these three women.  Lo and Behold, two of the three were digging into, yes, the scallop and pasta special that must have 'amazingly' re-appeared on the menu.\n\nBeing the curious type, I queried our server \"""" Is that indeed the scallop special that was sold out 45 minutes earlier?\""""  She looked around and exclaimed, \"""" They must have taken them off for a while while they prepared a new batch!\""""  To I replied, \n\""""But they were really sold out.  I offered to go to the store for you\"""".  \n\nShe took our a small dessert/coffee order and sheepishly walked away.\n\nWhen she came back to the table, she told us that the dessert (one item) and the coffee (only coffeee for our friends) were on the house for the inconvenience, and that:\n \n\""""Pam will be coming over to talk to you.\""""  \n\nThe four of us shared the single dessert and our friends drank their coffee.  We waited around talking for 30 minutes and, needless to say, Pam never showed up to smooth over the gaffe.  She didn't think it important enough to fess up to the screw up or to at least have the fortitude to apologize in person.  Truly disappointing and, for me, a restaurant death sentence.\n\nThe whole experience could have been handled so easily, but it wasn't.  Too bad. \nObviously, the four of us won't be back.\n\nAs an aside, I also can't stop drinking enough water for the last 2 hours.  It started after the entrees.",NEGATIVE

Based on YELP I narrowed down my choices and ultimately decided on Ted Weins because of its proximity to the shopping center(silly, I know).  Nearing 100k miles I knew the spark plugs on my Expedition would need to be changed soon.  Sure enough after a couple trips back and forth from LV/CA the engine light comes on! Auto Zone diagnosed the problem for free! It was a misfire on #5(i have a V8).  So there I go to Ted Weins to get it fixed! They wanted $100 just to diagnose but would use this towards work done if I did it with them! I agreed, but only replaced one plug bcuz they quoted me $1100 to replace ALL 8!!!!  I leave happy and sure enough the engine light comes on again! Auto Zone diagnosed it for free again and now its a misfire on #6!  So I go to Ted Weins about 3pm to get the work done but they want to charge another $100 to diagnose it! A short time later I get a call and confirm what I already knew, a misfire on #6!  But, they tell me it's late and they can't finish before closing time(which they should of said b4 the diagnosis).  So I leave without paying the $100 with a promise to return, hence the reason they didn't charge me the $100 for the work they couldn't do that day anyway.  The next couple days the weathers horrible and I don't return.  Then I get a self induced illness(hang over).  I finally return to a not so pleased salesman who says he's on the hook for the $100 he \""""should of charged me.\""""  So I agree to have #6 replaced but NOW the work comes with a disclaimer of the plugs are VERY sensitive and need to be replaced when car is cool to avoid any breaks otherwise it cost an extra $100(coincidentally the same amount I supposedly owe them for a diagnosis on work they couldn't do).  So I leave the truck, go to the shopping center and wouldn't you know I get a call saying \""""sorry, have to pay the extra $100, it broke while being replaced.\""""  Not being one to complain(like now) I paid and left...... Fast FWD to present and I'm in LA.  I go to Auto Zone again and buy 6 spark plugs(for cheap) for the remaining ones that need to be replaced!  I use YELP to find a place in LA(granted its a gas station in East LA) and the guy tells me $65 bucks to replace the remaining 6!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course I take the chance and return a few hours later to a perfectly working car! I ask the guy did any of them break when u took them out.  And in his best Splanglish accent he replies, \""""Na, ju just needs to no(know) what ger(your) doing.\""""......... Happy with my car now but definitely looking for a new mechanic in LV!!!!!!! The honorable thing to do at Ted Weins would of been I'm sorry I should of charged you the $100 and gave you the credit when u returned and my boss got mad; and not \""""let me find a way to get that $100 back.\""""",NEGATIVE

My Rainbow Roll with a hint of lemon was excellent fresh sushi, and the cornbread that followed was very good.  A Jumbo Lump Crab Cake with fresh Blue Crab, Carrot Salad & Chipotle Aioli was very good, featuring a fair amount of crab--not just filling--and refreshing thin cucumber slices mixed with carrot shavings.  I also enjoyed Rick's White Clam Chowder, which featured a generous amount of quite visible Top Neck Clams, potatoes, and bacon, and was chock full of celery and carrot.  The hot, off-white, and milky soup was interesting and very good.\n\nBut then some problems began to emerge.  One of my dining companions sent back his entree of Divers Scallops, complaining that they were almost ice cold and contained a bit of sand.  When the second batch arrived, he found them to be warm but still not hot, yet ate them this time.  Meanwhile I noted that my sauteed Pacific Halibut, presented with Fennel Silk, Shaved Apple, and Citrus Ragu', was warm rather than hot.  It was tasty, but half of this entree was soft and moist, and the other half was crisp and dry.  A somewhat unusual outcome! \n\nA dessert course of Key Lime Pie made with Swiss Meringue, and presented with sweet Cilantro Syrup, was very good tasting but not as cold as I believe Key Lime Pie should ideally be.  The meringue kisses that topped the large slice were quite nice, and the graham cracker crust perfectly baked.  The few drops of Cilantro Syrup were a nice complement to this dish applied in moderation. as an accent.  I detected just a slight flavor of cilantro, I believe mainly because I knew it would be there.  But the syrup tasted much more like an intense sweetener, and left no impression of a pureed leafy vegetable being placed on my tongue.\n\nSeating in leather booths was very comfortable, and service was generally good, but somewhat mixed.  At times Iced Tea refills were delivered without request, and at other times I had to ask for them.  I saw Chef/Owner Rick Moonen inside the restaurant engaged in conversation with two men at the bar, but never got to speak with him.  It is nice to know that he is a \""""hands on\"""" chef.  And, after the scallops exchange, a manager came over to apologize for the problem, took the item off the bill, and gave my friend a 25% off card for a future meal at the restaurant.\n\nThis was an exploratory outing, and I experienced enough that I liked to make a return visit, and try out some other seafood offerings at a future date.",POSITIVE

I'm from Ohio where you can grow plenty of food during the growing season, so I'm lucky to have experienced some wonderful markets there, and also in California. \n\nI was disappointed in this one.  I  was surprised at the dearth of produce.  I just expected many more produce booths and much more variety.  They are right to call this both a Farmer's and Artisan Market, as you definitely get both. I've gotten bath oils, original handmade crafts, and a tarot card reading here.  Unfortunately, I usually don't buy food here- it's just too expensive.  I must agree with Nicole W. who noted that the produce here is higher than at Whole Foods! I hate to walk away from a farmer's market with no food, but I just can't bring myself to pay that much money.\n\nI'm glad the market exists, even if I'll rarely buy anything, as it does make other people happy.",NEGATIVE

F*ck you. \n\nI flew into PHX from Jacksonville, FL a few days ago. When I was in the security line at JAX, I realized I had forgotten my driver's license in my running shorts at home. I freaked and broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure I wasn't getting on the plane. Then I remembered I have a concealed weapons permit, took it out and hoped for the best. \n\nThe TSA agent that checked my ID was very pleasant and said the ID was fine since I also had alternative means of proving that I was me. Those other items were my social security card, and believe it or not, a SAM's Club membership card which has my photo on it. They let me through, no problems. \n\nFast forward to today when I'm at PHX and trying to head back to Jacksonville. \nThe TSA agent says that my concealed weapon permit won't work even though I also showed him the same pieces of ID that I showed the agent in JAX. He called a manager. The manager said I could go through but would have to be \""""escorted\"""" by him as a +1. Let me explain to you what a plus one means...\n\nIt means they make you go through the peek-a-boo - I see you - X-Ray machine, THEN you get pulled over to the side and thoroughly frisked like a prison inmate, THEN they thoroughly go through all your shit even after it too had just passed through an X-Ray machine. Due to this, I had to throw away my hair product because apparently it was slightly too many ounces. Not happy about this. That hair product has passed through a number of airports with no problems BUT NOT AT PHX! \n\nAnyway, I'm sitting here in the terminal waiting for my flight, writing this review, stewing. I know I should be happy that I got through but Im not. \n\nThe TSA website says (I checked it before I ever came today):\n\n         'Adult passengers (18 and over) are required to show a U.S. federal or state-issued photo ID in order to be allowed to go through the checkpoint and onto their flight.'\n\nOn What Planet is a Concealed Weapon Permit, issued by the STATE of FLORIDA Not a STATE ISSUED photo-ID? \n\n        - It has my photo on it, my name, DOB, sex and race.\n        - It's Issued by the state of Florida\n\nWhat am I missing here!? So it doesn't have my address on it... Big f*cking deal! Why do you have to know my address!? You're trying to identify me, not pick me up for a date! \n\nIn addition, I had to go through an extensive background check to obtain that concealed weapon permit. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BREATHE AND KIND OF KNOW HOW TO DRIVE A CAR to get a driver's license. \n\nLook.... I know I'm the dumb ass for forgetting my driver's license but at what point did people lose the ability to use common sense? This was a ridiculous waste of everyone's time, in addition to being very frustrating. Have the terrorists won by default? Maybe they have.\n\n//end Ode\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo why 2 stars? Why not 1? Why not zero, half a star, a quarter of a star, negative stars? Well... because that isn't an option. Although, as anyone who has been through a shitty experience like this can attest, it would be phenomenal if it were possible.\n\nThe other reason for two stars is because this listing is for the PHX Airport as a whole and not just the TSA. \n\nI look at airports like this:\n\n1. Security is 60% of the review and what causes the most amount of anxiety                            for me so it weighs heavily on the total rating. \n   \n2. Then there's 25% for dining and drinking options\n \n3. 15% Everything else.\n\nThat said, PHX as a whole is decent. They have free WIFI which is always appreciated and they have a convenient bus system that runs on the regular to take you to the rental car building. \n\nI didn't get to peruse the dining options so I can't comment on that. Even if I had, I couldn't stomach dropping more than 2 stars after today. \n\nI know I'll be going back to PHX Airport. There's no way around it for me. I can certainly tell you that I won't forget my driver's license again. And with 100% assurity, I can also tell you... the PHX TSA WILL NOT be getting a Christmas card from me this year.",NEGATIVE

I'm cool with that, I've got roots close to there too. He was excited that there was finally a purveyor of fresh seafood (Fish n Chips shop) in his neighborhood. Three generations of one of the owners' family come to meet him and offer samples of their home smoked Gravlax style and peppered Salmon, moist (yet salty) Monk fish, and salmon p\u00e2t\u00e9 were all served up on a cold platter with toothpicks. We both tasted away. \n\nWhat a way to warm up the gullet, for the much anticipated heaping platter of 2 hefty pieces of beer battered Haddock, a virtual boat load of moist fries, cucumber covered mixed salad and some light yet tasty whipped tartar sauce. The batter was crispy and not lathered on too thickly. The fries had a nice taste without ketchup (as I found none handy), and just a splash of malt vinegar and ground pepper. The salad was fresh and healthy, but lacked any real dressing that I could detect (perhaps meant that way). I did manage to eat every last drop of food (despite being stuffed 2/3's of the way through). \n\nI also tasted their very unique velvety, almost a pur\u00e9e of clam chowder \""""chaudr\u00e9e de palourdes\"""" (not New England style, much to our Bostonian friends chagrin), which was distinguished nonetheless. I detected some kind of sherry like liquor and even a chunk of squash (I could be wrong about either). It also disappeared down the hatch. My new late lunch friend tried the fried calamari and was quite pleased with the batter.\n\nThere were many other items on the large chalkboard food and drink menu (above a large wooden communal table), including popcorn shrimp, house made butters and sauces i.e hot ketchup and Cajun mayo. I saw some people drinking beer with their meals (and before 5pm, nice).\n\nThe interesting thing about this shop is that is not only has a Fish n Chips menu, but they sell fresh fish/seafood and you can get it cooked for an extra $7.00 (now that sounds like a welcome dinner plan). Another notable - there was nary a smell of fish, which is rare in a shop selling fresh fish. \n\nBefore leaving I washed my hands in the small yet clean washroom, and then checked out the frozen foods for take out, such as seafood lasagna and lobster bisque. Next to the freezer section is the live lobster tank (priced to market, so take a look when you are there), and on the opposite walls are sushi making supplies, other accompanying ingredients and spices for sale.\n\nThey will probably garner that 5th star upon a second visit, as there was too much to try and not enough room in my stomach. \n\nI'm also glad they've opened up shop, but I'd better start saving up because I'll want to try it all - being the seafood lover I am.",POSITIVE

Why you ask? First off, for you chocolate lovers this is your mini Willy Wonka type store front you've been searching high & low for. Don't even bother with that overrated Serendipity outside Caesar's Palace. That place is a joke especially when you have this spot not too far away in walking distance. Second, if you order too much food off their regular menu, you may not have enough room to fully enjoy their sweet delicacies at the end. The food food was good but nothing spectacular. The quality of their chocolate is for sure up there and the dessert menu itself will blow you away. When we first sat down, we all reached for the dessert menu before the food menu. We spent most of the time looking it over back and forth.\n\nOff the bat, the d\u00e9cor of the place should stand out. Back in the day this store was actually a club that I visited once. I'm glad that they got rid of that and Max Brenner took over its spot. A little trendy, lots of chocolate theme props, and the never ending aroma of cocoa beans floating about especially in the downstairs part of the restaurant.\n\nThey do have a couple of cocktails and mixed drinks made with chocolate and your favorite alcohol. It will however will run you about $12-13 per drink. We went with the shakes instead. The Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake ($8) - vanilla ice cream, dark chocolate truffle is worth mentioning and should not disappoint if you so order it.\n\nFor dessert (to share), we had The S'Mores Concoction ($11) - marshmallow fluff, milk  chocolate mousse, graham crackers, caramelized bananas. This looked like your 11th grade science project more then anything. Even the grid looking palate it came out on reminded me of being in class again. Every prop used for this dish will make you nostalgic of those days you use to pass puppy love notes in class to that cutie you had a crush on. Personally, it was fancy to look at more then eating it. It was good but I probably won't revisit it again.\n\nThe Melt Chocolate Truffle Heart Cake & Shake ($14) was the winner. Milk and white chocolate heart cake served with a creamy vanilla ice cream, red berries, and an iced milk chocolate shot. That shot of chocolate is crack like. The chocolate heart cake reminds me a of lava cake that is perfectly complimented by the vanilla ice cream. You pour the milk and white chocolate yourself so you have the option to go easy or douse. Again, this look was very appetizing but the taste of everything worked well together in perfect harmony. I want more of that stupid shake shot! \n\nHonestly, there's just too much to order from their dessert menu. Whether it be a variety of hot chocolates, to hand dipping your own ice cream bars (which they were out of on this day), to their infamous fondues, or cr\u00e8me brulee/waffle dishes. The possibilities are endless. I don't think one trip to Max Brenner is sufficient. That is why I say go for their desserts and that's it.\n\nRemember, I'll forewarn you that it's not a cheap place to grab dessert and the portions are quite petite. What they lack in size makes up in taste and presentation. You will feel like a kid in a candy or in this instance, chocolate store.\n\nAlso, check out their $5 cookie out in the front stand if you don't want to go in and sit down. Yes, its $5 but it's a damn good $5 cookie. If they close the stand, just walk to the bar inside the restaurant and ask the bartender for the $5 cookie, they'll know exactly what you're talking about. It may not seem like it was worth it after the initial bite but you'll soon be asking for more of it. Yeah, it's legit son.",POSITIVE

So we stopped in Phoenix for the evening and this spot came with highest recommendations. Panko encrusted salmon for him and veggie rolls for me. I barely saw the plate set down before the salmon was devoured. The veggie roll however...man, did they put some spin on a pretty basic dish. I'm never wowed by sushi restaurants simply because I never order anything wow-able. They sure proved me wrong. Totally filling, deliciously flavorful and made exactly to my particular orders (not too big, rice paper, no seaweed, etc. etc.). We had the pesto tomato mozzarella salad and chicken satay (both specials) as well and while they were devoured pretty quickly they just don't stick out in my mind like those veggie rolls. A pretty innocuous dish that most would likely never seek out but if you have a finicky friend on the fence about joining you for a night at Sushi Roku, they cannot go wrong with this order.",POSITIVE

In all honesty, I've been taken back by how much I have started to love this joint. I haven't been to any other one, so this is my review of this fairly new location conveniently near the UNLV campus, easy access coming from school. The place has a good size, I came here and watched a UNLV basketball game and the environment was just right. There's a bar for drinks and of course the wings.\n\nAs soon as you walk on in, you are greeted with cheer. It doesn't feel like that greeting where they employees are forced to ask you how you're doing as part of their job description. I'm sure it's somewhere in there, but the times I've been there I've never felt like the welcome was never genuine. That is my humble opinion. This isn' necessarily a sit down and order restaurant, but you go on in and order at the front counter. The choices are endless, they have bone in wings, boneless wings and chicken tenders. Combos come with a side, usually a generous portion of fries or if you prefer fried mushrooms or pickles. It's all there. \n\nSo you order at the counter and find your seat with a number, you wait for a fair amount of time and you are greeted by name with your food. The sauces I've had are lemon pepper, parmesan garlic, original hot, hickory smoked BBQ and mild. None of them have been a disappointment. The first time I came here, I'll say I wasn't the biggest fan of the boneless wings. There was little too much breading, but it didn't ruin my virgin experience. I say get the bone-in wings because the wings are big, they are bigger than that other place everyone's on the nuts of. Your meal COMES WITH ranch, and not small, dainty container but a generous portion of ranch as your dipping sauce. \n\nI'm in love with wing stop. It is my new abode for wings. I prefer this over any other wing joint I've had in a while, because I feel like I'm welcomed and of course they give you the bang for your buck. Eat here, enjoy some beer and don't forget to thank them so graciously as you leave. Because you'll be coming back.",POSITIVE

I decided to come here after looking through yelp reviews for the most reviewed pho restaurants in China town. \n\nDefinitely 5 stars for cleanliness and promptness in their service for an Asian restaurant. This was probably the most clean Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Decor was modern and restaurant was big - great for big group gatherings or late night munching. They seemed fully staffed so whatever you asked for was done quickly. \n\nPho Kim Long serves many other dishes, both Vietnamese and Chinese food, so there's a lot to choose from. I ordered Beef Pho and was very satisfied with my selection. The beef slices were very tender! The portion of beef was generous in the size \""""small\"""" bowl. I have to compliment them on their soup - I know every pho restaurant uses MSG but this place seemed to use it sparingly. I wasn't super thirsty after eating and did not have a problem slurping up the soup either =) \n\nThis will definitely be my go-to spot if I'm ever back to visit! Come hungry, leave satisfied...especially after a long night of partying =D \n\nHappy Eating yelpers!",POSITIVE
